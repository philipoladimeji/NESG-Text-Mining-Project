The Summit was graced as \\nusual by dignitaries from various spheres of life. These \\nincluded: the Vice President of the Federal Republic \\nof Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, GCON; Executive \\nGovernors and Deputy Governors of numerous States; \\ndistinguished lawmakers; Federal ministers; captains \\nof industries; renowned academics; and other public \\nand private sector leaders. \\nThe theme of the Summit was auspicious, considering \\nthat Nigeria had only recently been jolted by the World \\nPoverty Clock, to the awareness that it had become \\nthe poverty capital of the world. With an estimated \\n86.9 million Nigerians believed to be living on less \\nthan US$1.90 a day, statistics from the Vienna-based \\nWorld Data Lab indicated that Nigeria had emerged as \\nthe country with the largest number of people living in \\nextreme poverty.\\nFrankly speaking, the warning signs have always been \\nthere: Only 69.5% of Nigeria™s teeming population of 197 \\nmillion people have access to clean water, a whopping \\n71% are plagued with poor sanitation, while tens of \\n\\nAccording to a recent report\\n1 by the International \\n1 https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2018/03/07/Nigeria-2018-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-\\nStatement-by-the-45699\\nMonetary Fund (IMF), Nigeria™s major developmental \\nchallenges include: a large infrastructure gap, high \\ngender and income inequality, pervasive corruption, \\n\\ncrisis in the North Eastern part of Nigeria. \\nThe country™s rampant education and healthcare \\nchallenges have also been highlighted in reports by \\nthe United Nations International Children™s Emergency \\nFund (UNICEF), World Health Organization and World \\nEconomic Forum. Of particular concern is Nigeria™s \\nranking as the country with the highest number of out-\\nof-school children, and one of the worst healthcare \\nsystems and infant & maternal mortality rates in the \\nworld. The Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), \\nwhich depicts the government™s economic growth \\nframework for Nigeria for the period 2017 - 2020, \\nprojected a GDP growth rate of 2.2% and a per capita \\nGDP of US$2,542 for 2017. However, according to the \\nNBS, Nigeria™s GDP growth for 2017 was 0.8%, far from \\nthe ERGP target. Although this growth lifted Nigeria \\n\\nyears, the country™s post-recession economy remains \\nfragile. The rate of GDP growth accelerated from \\n0.72% (in Q2 2017) to 2.11% (in Q4 2017) but tapered \\n\\n2018, respectively. \\nPOVERTY TO PROSPERITY: \\nMAKING GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS WORK\\n1. INTRODUCTION\\n6Based on data from the World Bank, Nigeria™s GDP per \\ncapita has also dipped over the last four years, since \\nreaching a ten-year high in 2014. \\nWith the above narrative, it became imperative to bring \\nrelevant stakeholders together at NES #24 to share \\na unifying narrative on good governance and strong \\ninstitutions, and the need for governments at all levels \\nto focus on the critical and urgent task of moving 87 \\nmillion Nigerians out of extreme poverty. \\nThe key objectives of the Summit were to: \\nŁ Underscore the link between good governance \\nand economic growth and development \\nŁ Highlight the current state of governance and the \\nchallenges in delivering public services\\nŁ Map key governance indicators on human \\ndevelopment outcomes\\nŁ Set an agenda that emphasizes citizens™ dividend \\nas a measure of good governance.\\nThe consensus of stakeholders at the Summit was \\nthat Nigeria still has prospects, not only for full \\neconomic recovery but also for rapid and sustainable \\neconomic growth and development. However, this \\nhope for economic transformation will become reality \\n\\nfocused on and able to implement policies for inclusive \\ngrowth. \\nThe following pages contain a summary of the \\n\\nconstraints to good governance in Nigeria, and the \\nwork plan highlighting the critical paths the country \\nmust navigate to achieve economic prosperity.\\n2. SUMMARY OF KEY DELIBERATIONS\\nThe discussions at the Summit were structured on \\n\\nselected indicators in the Ibrahim Index for African \\nGovernance) which served as the Summit™s Sub-\\nThemes: Corruption and Rule of Law; Effective \\nPublic Institutions; Participation and Citizens™ \\nRights; Sustainable Economic Opportunities; and \\nHuman Development. The Summit also included 11 \\nPolicy Commission breakout sessions (facilitated \\nby the National Economic Summit Group Policy \\nCommissions). Facilitators of these sessions \\n\\ngovernance issues relating to service delivery in their \\nfocus sectors/areas. \\nWelcome and Opening Remarks\\nMr. Asue Ighodalo, Chairman of the National Economic \\nSummit Group (NESG), explained during his welcome \\nremark, that the choice of the Summit™s theme was \\ndriven by Nigeria™s overwhelming developmental \\nchallenges amidst modest economic growth. He \\nacknowledged the Nigerian economy™s gradual \\nrecovery from recession, the relative stability in \\nexchange rates and the growth in external reserves \\nduring the year. However, he emphasized that the \\ncountry remained vulnerable on multiple fronts Œ \\neconomic, social and political. These are underscored \\nby negative trends in human development conditions, \\nsuch as the recent jobs statistics from the National \\nBureau of Statistics (NBS), which indicate that \\nbetween January and September 2017, no less than \\n4 million Nigerians either lost their jobs; entered into \\nthe labour market afresh and remained unemployed; \\n\\n\\nexpressed optimism that the implementation of the \\nSummit™s outcomes would reverse this troubling trend.\\nIn his opening remark, Senator Udoma Udo Udoma, \\nthe Honourable Minister for Budget and National \\n\\nthe importance of regular dialogue and engagement \\nwith the private sector, in recognition of the sector™s \\nrole in economic transformation. He highlighted \\nrecent successes in the implementation of the \\n\\nlabs established to address bureaucratic issues in \\nagriculture & transport, manufacturing & processing, \\nand power & gas. He also mentioned the Federal \\nGovernment™s four-year strategic plan for civil service \\nreform, which is intended to drive innovation in service \\nand institutionalize a citizen-oriented performance \\nmanagement system. The successful implementation \\nof this reform is pivotal to Nigeria™s transition from \\npoverty to prosperity.\\n7Keynote Address Œ Moving Nigeria Forward: Making \\nProsperity Work\\nThe opening remark was followed by the keynote \\naddress by Prof. Peter M. Lewis, Director, Africa & \\nMiddle East Programme at John Hopkins University, \\nUSA and author of Growing Apart: Oil, Politics, and \\nEconomic Change in Indonesia and Nigeria. \\nProf. Lewis acknowledged Nigeria™s great human \\ncapital potential and abundant resources, and the \\n\\nNigerian Economic Summit (NES) in 1993, which \\nhe attended. He also expressed his pleasure about \\nNigeria™s emergence as Africa™s biggest economy on \\nthe back of its annual average GDP growth of about \\n8% between 2002 and 2015. However, he noted that despite Nigeria™s potential and \\neconomic growth, the country has failed to break out \\n\\nthat can provide inclusively for its middle class, urban \\npoor and the rural masses. This is unlike countries \\nsuch as China, Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, \\nTurkey and Vietnam, which grappled with economic \\nstagnation and poor governance at some point, but \\n\\ndeliberate efforts. \\n\\ncase study for Nigeria because both countries have \\na similar history, structure, population size, and \\nethnic and religious diversity, but have navigated \\ndifferent economic paths over the last two decades. \\n\\nless than US$80 billion in the 1960s (based on 2010 \\nUS$). Both nations were predominantly monocultural \\neconomies that depended on crude oil exports in the \\n1970s. Both countries had national poverty rates of \\nover 50% in the 1980s, and transitioned to their current \\ndemocratic dispensation in the late 1990s after a long \\nera of authoritarian rule. \\nHowever, today, Indonesia has evolved into a high-\\n\\na poverty rate of less than 10%, a GDP of over US$1 \\ntrillion, and a GDP per capita of approximately US$4,000 \\n(based on 2010 US$). On the contrary, Nigeria is still \\na monocultural economy, with an extremely poor \\npopulation of about 50%, and GDP and GDP per capita \\n\\n2 CIA World Fact book.\\n3 Supplementary Document 16: Sector and Institutional Analysis, Indonesia: Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management ProgramŠCoral \\nTriangle Initiative Project.\\n4 CIA World Fact book.\\nIndonesia was able to transition its economy \\nby focusing on boosting its manufacturing and \\nagricultural sectors, diversifying its export potentials \\nand reducing its population growth rate. The country \\nalso embarked on a string of reforms which have \\nreduced layers of government regulation, leveraged \\nregional trade integration, and opened new areas \\nof the economy to private investment. The country \\n\\nredirecting its spending to development priorities.\\n2 At the root of Indonesia™s economic breakthrough \\nwas the enactment of laws on national development \\nplanning, particularly its Law Number 25 of 2004 \\non the National Development Planning System, \\nand Law Number 17 of 2007 on Long-term National \\nDevelopment Plan of 2005-2025 (known as the \\n\\n\\nyear-long National Medium Term Development Plans \\nwhich are developed by national ministries, provincial \\nand district governments, and run parallel with the \\n\\nThe National Plan also formed the basis for the \\nMasterplan for Acceleration and Expansion of \\nIndonesia™s Economic Development (MP3EI) which \\nwas unveiled in 2011.  The MP3EI documents \\nIndonesia™s ambition of becoming one of the world™s \\nlargest economies by 2025 with expected per capita \\nincome of US$14,250-US$15,500 and total GDP of \\nUS$4.0-$4.5 trillion. This is to be fuelled by a projected \\nannual economic growth of 7 to 8% between 2013 and \\n2025, and massive investments by the private sector.\\n3 \\n The concerted implementation of the RPJPN 2005-2025 \\nand its related plans by successive national, provincial \\n\\nhas transformed Indonesia into the biggest economy \\nin Southeast Asia and the 7th biggest economy in \\nthe world  based on GDP Purchasing Power Parity,\\n4  with a GDP per capita that has risen astronomically \\nover a seventeen-year period.\\nProf. Peter M. Lewis posited that Nigeria must make \\nthe following strategic choices to get out of its poverty \\nrut and evolve into a high-growth, competitive and \\nprosperous country:\\n8Ł Build and empower an effective economic team\\nŁ Strengthen peak economic institutions\\nŁ Enable alliances between urban entrepreneurs \\nand rural producers\\nŁ Break through critical bottlenecks in infrastructure, \\nnotably electricity Ł Create a more predictable environment for \\ntransactions.\\nThe Role of Governance and Institutions in Moving \\nNations from Poverty to Prosperity\\nProf. Peter Lewis emphasized during his keynote \\naddress that \\n‚it™s not the labels, it™s not the regions, it™s \\nthe politics™ \\nthat bring about the transition of a country \\nfrom a stagnant economy to a prosperous one. This \\nview is supported by several studies, three of which \\nare cited below:\\nŁ Determinants of economic growth: a cross-country \\nempirical studyAn empirical study was conducted by Robert Barro\\n5  across 100 countries over a 30-year period from 1960 \\nto 1990 to test for key determinants of economic \\ngrowth. In terms of government policies, the study \\nshowed that the growth of GDP per capita was \\n\\n\\nless government consumption. \\nThe study also showed that lower fertility rates, higher \\nnumber of secondary and higher education schooling, \\nand longer life expectancies tend to foster economic \\ngrowth especially for countries with lower levels of \\nreal GDP per capita. \\nŁ The role of institutions in growth and development\\nDaron Acemoglu and James Robinson \\nargued in their paper on the above subject\\n6 , that the main determinant of differences in prosperity \\nacross countries are differences in economic \\ninstitutions, and that the prevailing institutional \\nframework is the product of a political process. \\n5 http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan027110.pdf\\n6 Acemoglu, D., & Robinson, J (2008). The Role of Institutions in Growth and Development. Commission on Growth and Development. \\nWorking Paper No.10\\n7 http://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2007/wp54_2007.pdf\\n\\ndepend on the nature of political institutions and the \\ndistribution of political power in society. \\nThey further posited that in order to have a better \\nunderstanding of underdevelopment, one must \\nunderstand why different countries get stuck in political \\nequilibria that result in bad economic institutions. \\nTherefore, solving the problem of development entails \\nunderstanding what instruments can be used to push \\na society from a bad to a good political equilibrium. \\nŁ Governance, Economic Growth and Development \\nsince the 1960sMushtaq Khan\\n7 carried out an empirical study over a \\nforty-year period from 1960 to 2000. The study analysed \\nmore than 112 countries across several indicators \\nincluding property rights, political instability, control \\nof corruption, rule of law, voice and accountability, \\nregulatory quality and government effectiveness. The \\nstudy showed that governance capacity (the presence \\nof strong institutions to implement strategies) was \\nimportant to economic growth. \\nThe following chart depicts the relationship between \\neffective governance (using Corruption Perception \\nIndex as an indicator) and economic prosperity (using \\nGDP per capita as the metric) for nine emerging \\neconomies over a ten-year period from (2008 Œ \\n2017). Although the chart does not establish a \\ncausal connection between effective governance and \\neconomic growth, it highlights the fact that the four \\nemerging economies (i.e. China, India, Indonesia and \\n\\nin governance performance have experienced high \\neconomic growth.\\n9Summit Opening Address\\nFollowing the keynote address, the Vice-President, \\nProf. Yemi Osinbajo, GCON, gave the Summit™s opening \\naddress on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari, \\nGCFR. The Vice President commenced the address by \\n\\ncannot afford the bare essentials Œ food, shelter and \\nclothing Œ or, according to the World Bank, a condition \\nwhere people live on less than US$1.90/day. \\nReferencing statistics from the NBS, the Vice \\nPresident noted that in Nigeria, poverty levels have \\nrisen even during periods of economic growth:  in \\n\\nŒ 34.7m; 1992 Œ 39.2m; 1996 Œ 67.1m, 2004 Œ \\n66.7m and 2010 Œ 112.47m. These statistics are \\ncorroborated by data from Oxfam which indicate that \\nthe number of Nigerians living below the national \\npoverty line increased from 69 million in 2004 to 112 \\nmillion in 2010, despite the fact that Nigeria™s annual \\neconomic growth rate averaged 7%, and the number of \\nmillionaires grew by 44%, during the period.\\n8The Vice President adduced four reasons for this \\n\\ncorruptionﬂ i.e. the direct looting of the treasury by \\n\\nfor illegitimate personal use and enrichment at the \\nexpense of the citizenry. \\n8  Oxfam (2017). Inequality in Nigeria: Exploring the Drivers\\nThe second reason Œ which according to the Vice \\n\\ninvestment in infrastructure and creation of an \\nenabling environment for businesses. Third, is a lack \\n\\nwhile the last reason is low investment over the years \\nin the informal sector, which comprises businesses at \\nthe bottom of the economic pyramid.\\nThe Vice President emphasized that high government \\nrevenues will only result in increased prosperity if the \\nrevenues are invested in infrastructure, economic \\n\\nprotection for the poorest of the poor, through a \\n\\nto provide the Federal Government™s scorecard in this \\nregard under the current administration.\\nSources: Transparency International; World Bank\\n10Pillar I Œ Corruption and Rule of Law: Push for Zero Tolerance\\nPoverty and inequality in Nigeria are not due to lack of \\nresources, but to the misappropriation of the country™s \\nabundant resources. At the root of this is a culture of \\ncorruption and rent-seeking combined with a political \\nelite that is out of touch with the daily struggles of \\naverage Nigerians. The overlap between political and \\neconomic power bends the allocation of opportunities, \\nincome and wealth to vested interests, and biases \\npolicy-making in favour of a select few. \\nUnsurprisingly, Nigeria ranks as one of the most corrupt \\ncountries in the world. According to Transparency \\nInternational™s 2017 CPI, Nigeria is currently the 148th \\nleast corrupt (or the 33rd most corrupt) country of the \\n180 countries surveyed, with a CPI score of 27/100. \\nThis is relatively worse than Nigeria™s rank of 136 out \\nof 176, and score of 28/100 in 2016. \\nThis binding constraint was the focus of the opening \\nplenary session on Corruption and Rule of Law, which \\nwas moderated by Prof. Ngaire Woods (Founding Dean \\nof the Blavatnik School of Government and Professor \\nof Global Economic Governance, University of Oxford). \\nThe session was in the form of a Presidential Dialogue \\nwith President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, who was \\nrepresented by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, \\nGCON.The Vice President reiterated during the session that \\ngrand corruption remains one of the major challenges \\n\\nof the majority, hampers economic development and \\nwidens the inequality gap. It was noted at the session that, despite Government™s \\nanti-corruption efforts, corruption has prevailed at \\nboth the national and sub-national levels due to the \\nfollowing factors:\\nŁ Ineffective public and judicial system\\nThe current judicial process is inherently ineffective \\nin expediting judgments on corruption cases; \\nconsequently, many corruption cases linger for many \\nyears.\\nŁ Culture of impunity and poor accountability in \\ngovernment\\n\\n\\nwith impunity, thanks to the country™s weak political \\nwill, poor accountability structure and Constitutional \\nImmunity Clause.Ł Poor remuneration in the public service\\nThere is a broad consensus (supported by empirical \\nresearch) that poor remuneration of civil servants in \\ndeveloping countries encourages corruption.\\nŁ Lack of cooperation from the international \\ncommunity in the recovery of looted funds\\nThe government often receives little support in \\nrecovering looted funds domiciled overseas partly \\nbecause of the existing opaque information systems \\nthat protect foreign assets in such countries.\\nThe key recommendations that were proffered to \\naddress these issues include:\\na.  Sustain the Reforms of the Judicial System to \\nImprove Rule of Law and Enhance Prosecution of \\nCorruption Cases Ł Build effective public and judicial institutions\\nGovernment should push for reform of the judicial \\nsystems to achieve a fair and speedy prosecution \\nof corruption cases in both federal and state court \\nsystems. This should cover: the review of obsolete \\nlaws; implementation of checks and balances \\nto enable effective disciplinary actions for erring \\n\\n\\nmeritocracy.\\nb. Strengthen Partnership with International \\nCommunity and Private Sectors to Address the \\nChallenges of CorruptionŁ International support on anti-corruption\\nGovernment should drive international support for \\nNigeria™s anti-corruption drive by building effective \\npartnership with the international community and \\nforeign governments to designate stolen funds in \\nsimilar manner as terrorist funds, and to fast-track the \\nrepatriation of such funds to Nigeria.\\nŁ Private sector and citizen participation in the \\ncorruption drive\\n11The private sector should support the government™s \\nanti-corruption drive by leveraging the Whistle Blower \\nPolicy to report corrupt practices by government \\n\\nplayers that aid them.\\n\\nThe consensus by the participants at the session was \\nthat, although public institutions do not formulate \\npolicies, they implement them. Therefore, they play \\na critical role in translating policy objectives to their \\ndesired outcomes. Unfortunately, effective public \\ninstitutions have failed to emerge in Nigeria, resulting \\nin the suffocation of well-intended government \\npolicies. \\nresponsible for Nigeria™s current institutional failure: \\nŁ Bureaucratic model of public service\\nThe Nigerian bureaucratic model of public service is \\n\\nservice delivery. Interestingly, Britain, from which we \\ninherited this civil service model, has since moved to \\nmore contemporary models for public-sector service \\ndelivery. \\nŁ Ineffective performance management system\\nThe performance management system within the \\nNigerian public service is ineffective Œ as it largely \\nfocuses on inputs and activities, rather than on output \\nand desired results. The system relies on a subjective \\nassessment criterion, which promotes loyalty and \\ncompliance, instead of productivity and personnel™s \\nability to make a positive impact.\\nŁ Delay in adopting technology\\nThe public service has been a laggard in the adoption \\nof technology, and this has negatively impacted on \\nproductivity as well as quality of information for \\ndecision-making and monitoring.\\nŁ Ineffective implementation of public service \\nreforms\\nThere have been several attempts in the past to \\nreform the Nigerian Public Service; however, none \\nyielded the desired transformational outcome. The \\nineffectiveness of such proposed reforms have been \\ntied to: the high cost of implementing reforms; zero \\nbuy-in from critical stakeholders; and lack of political \\nwill. It was agreed that the following actions, if duly \\nimplemented, would improve Nigeria™s institutional \\ncapacity:a.  Accelerate Transformation of  the Civil Service at \\nFederal and State Levels by Leveraging Capabilities & \\nExperience in the Private Sector to Build an Effective \\nPublic Institution in NigeriaŁ Develop, roll-out and implement a comprehensive \\ncivil service transformation plan at federal and \\nstate levels \\nA comprehensive public service transformation plan \\nshould involve a holistic human capital assessment \\nto identify skills gaps, assess existing compensation \\nstructure, etc. in order to raise the value of human \\ncapital. It would also involve the development of an \\neffective performance management system and \\na pragmatic change management programme. \\nImportantly, an implementation of robust \\ncompensation and consequence management framework will be key to building a motivated civil \\nservice as well as track private sector talents. \\nLeverage public-private sector collaboration to drive \\ntransformation in the civil service\\nA platform for private sector participation in the \\ntransformation of the civil service needs to be \\nimplemented. A public-private partnership in this \\nmanner would help to broaden the skill set of public \\nworkers, hone their talents, and imbibe a service \\nmind-set and a good work ethic, thus enabling a more \\nresponsive work culture in public institutions.\\n12Pillar III Œ Sustainable Economic Opportunities Œ Ending the Vicious Cycle\\n9  Nigeria moved a notch down to 146th in the 2019 EODB Index. \\nIn 2016, the World Bank highlighted the need for \\nNigeria to create about 40 million jobs for it to be able \\nto cater for new market entrants by 2030. Government \\n\\n14.7 million jobs by 2020, in the ERGP. \\nHowever, this appears to be considerably off-track, as \\nthere has been an uptick in the country™s unemployment \\nand underemployment statistics from 2017 to date.\\nWhile the country witnessed a slight improvement \\nin its ranking in the 2018 World Bank™s Ease of \\nDoing Business Index (145th in 2018 compared to \\n169th in 2017)\\n9, a number of factors still hinder the \\ngovernment™s achievement of sustainable economic \\ndevelopment.\\nThe discussants highlighted the following issues as \\nthe major road blocks to the creation of a globally \\ncompetitive economic environment:\\nŁ \\n\\nthe much-needed economic growth. 2017 data reveal \\n\\nwhich is far below that of Egypt ($13.3 billion), its \\nAfrican neighbour. In addition, entrepreneurs are \\n\\n\\neconomic development.\\nŁ Hostile business and investment environment\\nThe business and investment environment in Nigeria \\nhas deterred the realisation of the growth potential and \\nviability of businesses, especially small businesses. \\nThree key factors limiting the attractiveness of \\nNigeria™s economic environment are: high cost of doing \\nbusiness, high-risk investment climate and distortion \\nof market mechanism by government™s interventions \\nand policies. Ł Poor implementation of economic policies and \\nstrategies\\nThe failure to translate economic policies and \\nstrategies to sustainable economic development can \\nbe attributed to: inadequate understanding of Nigeria™s \\neconomic problems by policy-makers, inconsistency in \\npolicy formulation, poor implementation of economic \\npolicies and strategies and lack of collective action \\nof critical stakeholders to drive economic growth and \\ndevelopment.\\nThe recommendations posited as the critical paths \\nto take in ending the vicious cycle of economic \\nstagnation, include:  a. Enhance Nigeria™s Economic and Sectorial \\nStrategies & Policies and Strengthen Capabilities to \\nDrive Implementation to Achieve a Faster Economic \\nGrowth Rate\\nŁ Align governments, regulators and agencies to \\nfocus on long-term growth as well as attraction of \\nprivate capital investment\\nThe philosophy of government and regulators should \\nbe geared towards long-term economic growth rather \\nthan short term revenue generation. Government also \\nneeds to sustain current economic policies that are \\nyielding positive results and also to emphasise on \\n\\nŁ Revive sectorial strategy\\nGovernment should provide a clear strategic roadmap \\nfor stimulating growth in critical areas of the economy \\nsuch as agriculture, mining, power, logistics and the \\ncreative industry. Consultative industry groups should \\ntherefore be revived (or set up where necessary) \\nto drive innovation in these sectors. These groups \\nshould identify the critical binding constraints (such \\nas infrastructural gaps, inadequate funding, ineffective \\npolicy formulation and execution, etc.), tackle industry-\\n\\ninnovative solutions to boost the economy. \\nb.  Drive Targeted Investment to Boost the Rural \\nEconomic Climate and Strengthen Entrepreneurship \\nin order to create Sustainable Economic Opportunities \\nand End the Vicious Cycle of Poverty\\nŁ Improve rural economic climate\\nThere is the need for an increased focus on improving \\neconomic climate in rural areas by investing in micro-\\ngrids for electricity supply and feeder roads for access \\nto markets. According to data from the World Bank, \\nonly 3% of the Nigerian population work in the formal \\nsector. Therefore, the implementation of key economic \\n\\nimproving livelihoods and combating poverty.\\n 13Ł Strengthen entrepreneurship and informal \\nBusinesses by improving access to affordable \\n\\nmarkets.\\n\\nand businesses in the informal sector are critical in \\nboosting entrepreneurial activity. Furthermore, there \\nshould also be dialogues between large corporations \\nand SMEs to further enhance the value chain \\ncontribution of SMEs to large corporations.\\nŁ Promote environmental sustainability\\n Government policies aimed at promoting \\nenvironmental sustainability should be premised on \\ndriving innovation to achieve cost optimization and \\nmarket competitiveness. Examples of such initiatives \\ninclude: standardization of the adoption of light-\\nweight plastics for food and beverage manufacturers, \\nalternatives to synthetic detergent packaging, \\neradication of plastics in certain spaces such as retail \\nstores, etc.\\nPillar IV Œ Participation & Citizens™ Rights: Citizens Dividend as a Measure of Good Governance\\nA truly democratic society should create a functional \\nsystem for effective participation by the electorate. At \\nthe root of this is the need for the electorate to possess \\na high degree of freedom to not only elect its political \\nleaders but also to hold them accountable.  However, \\ncitizen participation and rights extend beyond the \\nexercise of political franchise.\\nCitizen participation in Nigeria is relatively low. Real \\nengagement by the political class is often limited to \\nthe electioneering season. Citizens™ rights are also \\nseldom respected. This has resulted over time in a \\ngeneral sense of frustration, despondency and even \\npowerlessness, in the masses.Although Nigeria ranks highly in the list of countries \\nwith a high number of internet users, the Nigerian \\ngovernment has failed to leverage the internet as a \\nmeans of effective engagement with citizens since the \\ncountry™s return to democratic rule in 1999. According \\nto a 2018 E-Government Development Index, Nigeria \\nranks 143 out of 193 countries, in the use of information \\nand communications technologies in delivering public \\nservices. Thus, despite the Nigerian society getting \\nmore interconnected through technology, Nigerians \\nare often still disconnected from policy decisions that \\nshape and impact their lives.\\nThe discussants raised the following issues as the \\nfactors that could be responsible for the disconnection \\nbetween the government and the populace:\\nŁ Poor awareness of existing Government platforms \\nfor citizen participation\\n\\nFederation, in May 2018, developed an e-participation \\nportal as a means of engaging with citizens. However, \\nowing to poor publicity, amongst other factors, the \\nplatform has not proved to be effective.  \\nŁ Inadequate demand from citizens for their rights\\nNigerian citizens are not doing enough in demanding \\n\\nThis partly stems from the fact that many citizens do \\nnot know their rights. According a recently conducted \\npoll, only few Nigerians have read the Constitution.\\nCitizens™ lack of trust in Government and its initiatives\\nAs a result of poor governance and weak institutional \\nintegrity, there is hardly cooperative reception \\nto proposed government initiatives, such as the \\ndevelopment of collaborative platforms. Also, \\nnon-functionality of existing platforms aimed at \\nimproving citizen participation such as Servicom, \\nand government™s failure to keep past promises, has \\nfurther increased citizen™s skepticism of government™s \\nengagement channels.Ł Lack of a holistic approach to citizens™ engagement\\nThe Government does not have engagement platforms \\ntargeted at various citizen classes, which makes it \\nimpossible to properly capture general public opinion. \\nAlso, there seems to be a lack of collaboration between \\nall levels of governments and MDAs in developing \\nthese initiatives. Consequently, there has been a \\nsurfeit of ineffective initiatives across the country.\\nTo foster greater citizen participation, the following \\nsolutions were suggested:\\n14Enhance Citizen Participation in Governance\\nŁ Increase collaboration between government, \\nprivate sector and civil society organisation \\nThe partnership between civil society organisations, \\nprivate sector participants and the Government should \\nbe reinforced to enhance the use of engagement \\nplatforms by citizens. This is a key component of \\nﬁopen governance partnershipﬂ (OGP) that would help \\nto deepen government™s knowledge of the concerns \\nand suggestions of its citizens.\\n10  Oxfam (2017). Inequality in Nigeria: Exploring the Drivers\\n11  This is an indicator of long-term progress across three dimensions of human development: long and healthy life, access to knowl\\n-edge and standard of living\\n12  This is an indicator of long-term progress across three dimensions of human development: long and healthy life, access to knowl\\n-edge and standard of living\\nŁ Increase demand for Government™s accountability\\nCitizens need information to hold their government \\naccountable. Admittedly, the government has begun the \\ndevelopment of an OGP approach towards information \\ndissemination, such as the open budgeting process \\nwhich is led by the Ministry of Budget and National \\nPlanning. However, there is the need for information \\non real-time Government spending in order for citizens \\nto track and hold all levels of government accountable. \\nPillar V Œ Human Development: Investing in our People\\nAccording to Oxfam, Nigeria™s annual economic \\ngrowth rate averaged 7% in the 2000s. During this \\nperiod, the number of millionaires in the country grew \\nby approximately 44%.\\n10  Ironically, the number of \\npeople living below the national poverty line increased \\nby 62%, from 69 million in 2004 to 112 million in \\n2010. Nigeria™s ranking on the United Nation™s Human \\nDevelopment Index\\n11 has also deteriorated over the \\npast three years (see chart below). This trend has \\nremained unchanged in recent years, if the latest \\nWorld Poverty Clock report which indicates that six \\nNigerians slip into abject poverty every minute, is \\nanything to go by. \\nNigeria ranks as one of the countries in the world \\nwith the highest number of maternal, infant and \\nchild mortality (1 in every 13 expectant mothers dies \\nat child birth). On educational development, recent \\nstatistics by the UNICEF show that Nigeria has the \\nhighest number of out-of-school children in the world: \\n\\nnot go to school! These narratives are evident when \\none considers Nigeria™s ranking on the United Nation™s \\nHuman Development Index\\n12 over the past three years \\n(see chart below). \\nTable 1: Human Development statistics\\nYear/Parameter\\n2014201520162017Human Development Index\\n (0 - 1) 1 being the best0.5240.5270.5300.532Human Development Index Ranking among 188 countries\\n151152156157      Source: United Nations HDI\\n      Table 2: Labour Force statistics \\nYear/Parameter\\nQ1 2016Q2 2016Q3 2016Q4 2016Q1 2017Q2 2017Q3 2017Unemployment rate (%)\\n  12.113.313.914.214.416.218.8Underemployment rate (%)\\n19.1   19.319.72120.421.121.2Unemployment & Underemployment rate (%)\\n31.232.633.635.234.837.340      Source: NBS\\n15The discussants highlighted Nigeria™s human \\ndevelopment challenges to include the following:\\nŁ Population growth currently outpaces economic \\ngrowth\\nNigeria™s burgeoning population (which is growing at \\nan annual rate of 2.6%) has outpaced the country™s \\nslow economic growth, thus placing a huge strain on \\nthe limited resources available to cater for the welfare \\nof the populace. This has also undermined the impact \\nof several poverty alleviation measures and initiatives \\nwhich have been implemented by the government and \\ninternational development organizations over time.\\nŁ Massive backlog of investment in health and \\neducation infrastructure\\nMany initiatives that have been undertaken to attract \\n\\nhealth and education sectors have proven to be \\nineffective. This is due to the fact that there is still a \\n\\nthe sectors and current infrastructural capacity, and \\nthere are no clear, convincing government policies in \\nplace to woo investors to participate in these critical \\nsectors.\\nŁ \\nexisting problems in health and education\\n\\nserves as a measure of the quality of investment in \\ncore sectors Œ in the health and education sectors \\nin Nigeria are relatively low, compared to those of \\ndeveloped countries with functional systems and \\n\\ncapital investment in infrastructure which are critical \\nto solving existing sectorial challenges.\\nŁ Dearth of technical capacity amongst teachers and \\ntrainers in primary and early secondary schools\\nThe educational sector has also been plagued by \\n\\neducators. Also, the Nigerian educational curriculum \\nis currently outdated and not in line with globally \\nacceptable standards. Such factors undermine the \\nquality of learning at both primary and secondary \\nschools, and invariably impact the developmental \\npotential and performance of students.\\nTo combat these challenges, the following solutions \\nwere proffered:\\nAccelerate & Boost Investment in Social Infrastructure, \\nHealth and Education to Dramatically Reverse the \\nDeclining Human Development Outcomes\\nŁ \\nphysical and social infrastructure \\nEfforts must be geared towards attracting private \\ncapital (both local and foreign). This can be achieved \\nby making deliberate effort to reduce the risk of \\nbusiness failure for these investments, putting \\nappropriate risk management processes around the \\nfunding of infrastructure projects, and developing an \\neffective Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework \\nfor infrastructure projects. \\nThere is also the need for an increased budgetary \\nallocation towards education, review of the existing \\ncurriculum, support of private sector-led initiatives, \\nand the development of incentive packages for \\nattracting and retaining talent in the sector. Federal \\nand State Governments could also issue bonds against \\nproductive assets with proven track record of stable \\n\\n\\nŁ Increase investments and implement policies to \\nimprove Nigeria™s health and education outcomes\\n There should be continued intervention in immunisation \\nand nutrition. The Government should bolster its \\nefforts to ensure that all children are immunized and \\nprovided with access to basic education. Policies \\ngeared towards affordable healthcare and the proper \\nnourishment of expecting/nursing mothers should \\nalso be implemented.Furthermore, Government should improve technical \\ncapacity for primary and secondary schools education \\nby devising innovative ways of attracting top-\\nperforming individuals into the teaching profession. \\nThe Government should also consider leveraging \\nhighly skilled and experienced retired teachers to \\nbridge the technical capacity gaps in our primary and \\nsecondary schools. Refresher programmes could \\nbe introduced for these retired teachers to get them \\nready to go back to classrooms. \\nŁ Transform delivery of education by adopting \\ntechnology and partnership with entrepreneurs and \\nstart-ups. \\n16Government should implement innovative and \\nemerging technology that will foster education for \\n\\nregions as well provide access to free education to the \\nless privileged and vulnerable groups in the Nigerian \\npopulation. Furthermore, Government should develop \\npolicies that enable technology entrepreneurs to \\nbecome key players within the education sector and \\nprovide support for education technology incubators.\\n3.

CONCLUSION\\nThe Summit was convened to discuss the critical \\nissues that are attributable to our economic and \\ndevelopmental challenges as a nation and the role of \\neffective governance and institutions in driving the \\nmuch-needed transition from poverty to economic \\n\\nmillion people above the poverty line and, therefore, \\nchanging the narrative of Nigeria being the poverty \\ncapital of the world.Based on the outcome of the Summit, it became apparent \\nthat Nigeria™s governance and institutional challenges \\nstem from: ineffective judicial systems, impunity \\nand poor accountability, ineffective performance \\nmanagement system in public institutions, hostile \\nbusiness and investment environment, and the poor \\nimplementation of economic policies and strategies.\\nThe discussants at the Summit also noted that the \\nprospects of Nigeria™s human development have \\nbeen dimmed primarily by a massive backlog of \\ninvestment in health and education infrastructure. \\nAlso, citizens™ lack of trust and poor accountability \\n\\ndisenfranchisement of the majority of the populace.  \\nThe Summit birthed multifarious recommendations \\non how the Government can, through a goal-oriented \\ngovernance philosophy, combat corruption, address its \\ninstitutional shortcomings, accelerate human capital \\ndevelopment and promote a globally competitive \\nbusiness environment. To achieve this, the discussants \\nposited that, in order to achieve tangible results, the \\nGovernment needs to deviate from traditional political \\nrhetoric. \\nIt was, therefore, suggested that, the Government \\nneeds to focus on: building effective judicial \\ninstitutions, developing a comprehensive public \\nservice transformational plan, promoting investor-\\nfriendly economic policies, improving funding for \\ncritical infrastructure, and increasing demand for \\ngovernment accountability.\\nWhile these recommendations are laudable, the effect \\nof such transformational initiatives would only bring \\nabout tangible outcomes where the following critical \\nsuccess factors are duly considered: an alignment \\nof stakeholders™ recommendations with legislative \\npriorities, the development of a robust implementation \\nroadmap for strategic initiatives, the development of a \\nchange management plan, and a political will to drive \\nkey policy reforms.\\nFinally, it is expected that Nigerians would muster the \\n\\naccountable for the delivery of expected outcomes. \\nThis calls for a more transparent information system \\nthat allows the populace to make informed decisions \\non governance and institutional performance, and an \\nelectoral system that is above board.\\n252627MONDAY\\nOctober 22\\nPoverty to Prosperity: \\nMaking Governance \\nand Institutions Work\\n28Date: Monday, October 22, 2018\\nSession: Opening Session Time:09:50 Œ 12:00pmSpeakers: \\nWelcome Remarks: \\nMr. Asue Ighodalo, Chairman, Nigerian \\nEconomic Summit Group\\nOpening Remarks: Senator Udoma Udo Udoma, CON, \\nHonourable Minister for Budget and National Planning\\nKeynote Address:\\n Professor Peter Lewis; Director, Africa & \\nMiddle East Programme; John Hopkins University, USA\\nSummit Opening Address:\\n Professor Yemi Osinbajo, Vice \\nPresident, Federal Republic of Nigeria \\n29Welcome Remarks: \\nMr. Asue Ighodalo, Chairman, Nigerian Economic Summit Group\\nMr. Asue Ighodalo, the Chairman of the Nigerian \\nEconomic Summit Group (NESG), welcomed \\nparticipants to the 24th Nigerian Economic Summit. \\nHe noted that since its inception in 1993, the \\nNigerian Economic Summit had evolved to become \\nan enduring, important and cerebral platform for the \\npublic and private sector to engage in robust and \\nrigorous conversations about the Nigerian economic \\nchallenges. He stated that ﬁthe frank, and sometimes \\n\\n\\nReviewing developments since the last Summit, \\nMr. Ighodalo stated that the 2018 Macroeconomic \\nOutlook Report and the Report on the 23rd Nigerian \\nEconomic Summit was presented to the President \\non January 22nd 2018. He noted the passage of the \\nNational Transport Commission Bill by the National \\nAssembly and urged the President to speedily assent \\nto the Bill, as the passing of the Bill is expected to \\n\\nsector.  He also expressed the NESG™s expectation \\nof expeditious presidential assent to the Petroleum \\nIndustry Governance Bill, as soon as the National \\nAssembly resolves the few contentious issues raised \\nby the Presidency.  \\nThe Chairman of NESG Board reported that the NESG, \\nin conjunction with the Nigerian Bar Association \\nSection on Business Law,  partnered with the \\nNational Assembly through the National Assembly \\nBusiness Environment Roundtable (NASSBER) to \\nprovide content, promote, amend and prepare for \\npassage, bills that encourage and support private-\\nsector investments and improve the overall business \\nenvironment  He stated the Bills that the NESG expects \\nthe National Assembly to accelerate the passage as \\nfollows: amended Companies and Allied Matters Act Bill, \\nNigerian Railway Bill, National Roads Funds Bill, \\nFederal Competition and Consumer Protection Bill, \\nCoastal and Inland Shipping (Cabotage) Bill, and the \\nArbitration and Conciliation Bill. \\nMr. Ighodalo noted that while the Federal Government \\n\\nRecovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), the NESG expects \\nthe implementation process to continue unabated, \\nparticularly in the run-up to the general elections in \\n2019.  ﬁThere is no better time than now to keep our \\neyes on the ball because, no matter the outcome on \\n16 February 2019, we must all work to ensure that we \\nstill have a strong economy to build on, the morning \\nafterﬂ, he said. \\nHe noted that in 2017, the Nigerian economy had \\nstarted the recovery from recession which the country \\nexperienced between 2015 and 2016, which was the \\n\\nquarters of growth since March 2017. He noted that this \\nwas evidenced by reduction in cost of living, measured \\n\\n\\n\\nNigeria™s respectable jump in the World Bank Ease of \\nDoing Business ranking from 169 in 2016 to 145 by \\n2017 (with expectations of better rankings this year) \\nand the upward movement by ten places from our \\nrankings last year in the recently published 2018 WEF \\nGlobal Competitiveness Report, in which Nigeria was \\nranked 115 out of 140 countries and commended the \\nFederal Government for these efforts. \\nMr. Ighodalo observed that, despite these \\nimprovements, the country remains vulnerable on \\nmultiple fronts Œ economic, social and political, \\nunderscored by negative trends in several socio-\\neconomic indicators.  He referred to the latest jobs \\nreport from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) \\nthat showed that the combined unemployment and \\nunder-employment rates rose from 35.2% in the fourth-\\nquarter 2016 to 40% in the third-quarter 2017, implying \\nthat during the measurement period, over four million \\nNigerians either lost their jobs, entered into the labour \\nmarket and remained unemployed or were employed \\nat jobs that were inadequate to their economic needs. \\nHe urged the need for the country to deal with the \\ninsecurities at all levels. \\n30He noted that the Summit™s theme of ﬁPoverty to \\nProsperity: Making Governance and Institutions \\nWorkﬂ had the overarching objectives to stir up \\ndiscussions, create and share a unifying narrative on \\ngood governance, strong institutions and to focus \\ngovernments at all levels on the critical and urgent \\ntask of moving eighty-seven million Nigerians out \\nof extreme poverty.  He observed that the theme is \\nespecially apt given the upcoming general elections \\nnext year and echoed the importance of undertaking \\nthe electoral process with as little rancour as possible \\nand as much enlightenment of citizens as can be \\nmustered. Mr. Ighodalo thanked his predecessor, \\nMr. Kyari Bukar, on behalf of the NESG Board and \\nmanagement for his commitment and zeal in \\nachieving a better Nigeria. Lastly, he noted that ﬁNo \\nNigerian must be left behind and we must give all our \\npeople hope.ﬂ\\nOpening Remarks: Senator Udoma Udo Udoma, CON, Honourable Minister for Budget and \\nNational Planning  Senator Udoma Udo Udoma, the Honourable Minister \\n\\ngovernment™s prioritisation of regular dialogue and \\nengagement with the private sector, in recognition of \\nthe private sector™s role in economic transformation. \\nHe reported that in line with the ERGP, the government \\n\\nbetween March 13th Œ April 21st, 2018 to address \\nbureaucratic issues in three workstreams of \\nthe economy, namely: agriculture and transport, \\nmanufacturing and processing, and, power and gas. \\nBased on the foregoing, an ERGP delivery unit was \\nset up in the Ministry of Budget and National Planning \\n(MBNP) to work closely with ministerial delivery \\nunits in each of the six ministries responsible for the \\nsectors. \\nHe highlighted some key results of the labs as follows: \\nan expedited process for the Brass Fertilizer and \\nPetrochemical Company™s multi-billion dollar plant \\nwhich, if successful, could result in 20,000 direct and \\nindirect jobs, accelerated development of the National \\nGold Development Policy and the Federal Gold \\nReserve Scheme and support to Autodex Limited, a \\n\\nto double capacity for the production of farm tractors.\\nFor improved service delivery, Senator Udoma \\nhighlighted the Federal Government™s four-year \\nstrategic plan for civil service reform coordinated by \\nthe Head of Civil Service. He noted that ﬁthis reform \\nwould drive innovation in service and institutionalise \\na performance management system that is citizen-\\noriented.ﬂ He outlined several executive orders that \\nhad been issued by the President to improve service \\ndelivery and enhance transparency. \\nThe focus of some the Executive orders includes the \\npromotion of local content procurement by govern\\n-\\n-ness environment.  \\nSenator Udoma described the summit as an oppor\\n-tunity to examine the progress made through the \\nprogrammes, policies and objectives of the ERGP be\\n-cause ﬁgood governance at all levels is crucial for the \\nsuccess of the ERGPﬂ. He reminded participants that \\n\\nthemes of corruption and the rule of law, effective pub\\n-lic institutions, sustainable economic opportunities, \\nparticipation and citizens™ rights and, human develop\\n-ment. Furthermore, he expressed the expectation that \\nthe summit deliberations would yield useful recom\\n-mendations on how to enrich service delivery and to \\nreceive suggestions on how to enrich delivery of the \\nplan and services. He stated that ﬁwhile the ERGP is \\nclear there could always be improvements made on \\nthe delivery of the plan.ﬂ  \\n31Keynote Address: \\nProfessor Peter Lewis; Director, Africa & Middle East Programme; John \\nHopkins University, USA and Author, Growing Apart: Politics and Economic Change in Indonesia \\nand Nigeria Professor Peter Lewis of the Africa and Middle East \\nProgramme, Johns Hopkins University, stated that \\nNigeria had great potential in terms of human capital, \\ntalent, and resources, and had made progress over the \\n\\n(NES) in 1993. However, Nigeria continues to struggle \\nin realising the vision of a high-growth sustainable \\n\\n\\nnamely: international isolation, poor governance, \\neconomic stagnation, adverse policy outcomes, rising \\npoverty and high levels of corruption, the summit had \\nbecome a centre of dialogue on Nigeria™s economy \\nand development.  \\nHe observed that the discouraging pictures of the \\n1990™s were almost unrecognisable today, as Nigeria \\ncurrently had the largest economy in Africa, with Gross \\nDomestic Product (GDP) growing at an average rate \\nof 8% overall and yielding 5% per capita on average \\nbetween 2002 and 2015. This enabled average income \\n\\nof the fourth republic in 1999. He noted that, after \\ndecades of heavy dependence on oil, signs of possible \\n\\ninformation technology, media and entertainment, \\nagriculture and manufacturing were becoming more \\nevident. \\nProfessor Lewis observed that during the recent \\nrecession, non-oil GDP outperformed oil GDP and the \\n\\nperiod with modest growth outlook. \\nHe noted that the economic performance remained far \\nfrom the aspirations of the country™s leaders, elites and \\naverage citizens; and despite some improvements, the \\n\\neconomy that can provide inclusively for the middle \\nclass, urban poor and the rural masses had not been \\nachieved. He further noted that with the poverty rate \\nbeing consistently above 60% and a rapidly growing \\npopulation, more Nigerians are living at the margins \\nof poverty. He stated that although many policies had \\nbeen pursued jointly by the public and private sector to \\nmove Nigeria to a more prosperous economy; Nigeria \\nhad continued to struggle to breakout to make the \\neconomic transition.\\nHe stated that Nigeria™s struggle to achieve a high-\\n\\ncompared to several countries that had grappled with \\neconomic stagnation and poor governance such as \\nChina, Chile, Mexico, Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia, and \\nVietnam; but unlike Nigeria, these countries had made \\nconsiderable progress over the years. In particular, he \\ncompared Nigeria with Indonesia, based on similarities \\nin population size, status as economic anchors in their \\nrespective regions, ethnic and religious diversity, high \\nlevels of natural resources especially in oil and gas, \\nchallenging history of colonial rule, high levels of civil \\nviolence in the 60™s and over 30 years of military rule.\\nProfessor Lewis noted that despite the similarities \\nin history, background and structure between both \\ncountries; the trajectory of development was very \\ndifferent. From late 1960s through 1990, Indonesia™s \\neconomy grew positively and consistently over the \\n\\non oil, and poverty reduced from over 70% to 15%. \\nHowever, Nigeria has struggled to address high rates \\nof poverty and heavy dependence on oil.  He explained \\nthat Indonesia was able to transition its economy \\nby focusing on microeconomics; focusing more on \\nmanufacturing and agriculture, diversifying export \\npotential and reducing population growth. He advised \\nthat ‚it™s not the labels, it™s not the regions, it™s the \\npolitics™ that bring about the transition of a country \\nfrom a stagnant economy to a prosperous one. \\n\\nideas to potentially turn around the current situation in \\nNigeria, as follows:321. In cases of successful economic transition, a \\ndevelopment-oriented leadership has driven the \\nchange. 2. \\ninstitutions, modest changes can produce \\n\\n  There is a middle \\nground, thus focus on efforts that can move the \\nnation forward quickly, as the country doesn™t \\nhave to get it all right at once.\\n3. Focus on the binding constraints. \\nPriority should be placed on what needs to be done to move the \\ncountry forward and on the main obstacles to \\ngrowth, including: \\nŁ Electricity/ power Ł Ports and Roads, especially rural roads to get \\nproduce to the market\\nŁ Ease of capital transaction/ ease of moving \\nmoney around \\nŁ Education, which is critical especially for bridging \\nthe gap in gender education.1. Focus on livelihoods rather than jobs.\\n Eight out \\nof ten Nigerians work in the informal sector - \\nagriculture or urban services. The World Bank \\nstudies show that only 3% of the population in \\nNigeria work in the formal sector.\\n2. Revive industry sectoral strategies and \\npolicies. Develop consultant groups between \\nthe government and private sector focusing on \\nindustries such as metals and mining, automobile \\nmanufacturing. An alliance of government and \\nkey producer groups worked in Indonesia, China, \\nMexico and Vietnam. For instance, Vietnam went \\nfrom zero coffee production to number 2 in the \\nworld in about 15 years.  \\nIn conclusion, Professor Lewis offered two possible \\nscenarios for Nigeria. Firstly, Nigeria breaks out to \\na high-growth economy, building on recent policy \\nchanges and develops major institutions, utilising \\nthe country™s vast human potentials and resources to \\nelevate the economy into a powerful emerging market. \\nSecondly, the country remains a ‚stuck™ economy with \\nno breakout. He further explained that Nigeria can \\n\\nsetting the right priorities and implementing the right \\nstrategies, which include:\\nŁ Build and empower an effective economic team \\nŁ Strengthen peak economic institutions \\nŁ Pursue alliances with urban entrepreneurs and \\nrural producers \\nŁ Break through infrastructure bottlenecks, \\nespecially electricityŁ Create a more predictable environment for \\ntransactions \\nThese responses that have the potential to transition \\nNigeria™s economy to breakout to a high growth \\neconomy of prosperity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n33Summit Opening Address: \\nHis Excellency, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, GCON, Vice President \\nof the Federal Republic of Nigeria \\nThe Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, \\nProfessor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, GCON, declared open \\nthe 24th Nigerian Economic Summit on behalf of the \\nPresident, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari.\\nProfessor Osinbajo expressed his pleasure at being at \\nthe 24th Nigerian Economic Summit as a representative \\nof the President of Nigeria. He noted that the Nigerian \\nEconomic Summit Group had promoted dialogue and \\ncollaboration between government and the private \\nsector which had led to several joint interventions \\nand worthy initiatives over the years. He also added \\nthat the summit created a regular opportunity for the \\ngovernment to review the conditions and policies \\nthat impact on overall economic performance and \\nto collaboratively interrogate some of the important \\nideas and prescriptions proffered for the Nigerian \\neconomy.\\n\\ncondition where people cannot afford the essentials \\nof life Œ food, shelter and clothing Œ or according to \\nthe World Bank, people who live under $1.90 per day. \\nHe explained that over the last decade, the poverty \\nsituation in the country had become possibly the \\nbiggest economic challenge for Nigeria and that \\nthe condition had persisted even when the nation™s \\nearnings were at an all-time high. To buttress his point, \\nhe referred to the recent Nigerian Bureau of Statistics \\n(NBS) survey which clearly depicted that despite rising \\n\\nevery survey cycle and that in 1980 absolute poverty \\n\\n1992 Œ 39.2m, 1996 Œ 67.1m, 2004 Œ 66.7m and in \\n2010 Œ 112.47m. The Vice President explained that the problem \\n\\ndevelopment indices of the country had become more \\n\\ngrow at about 3% annually, and the country is projected \\nto become the world™s third most populous nation \\nby 2050. Of that population, over 60% will be young \\npeople with about 1.4m entering the job market every \\n\\nrising poverty and unemployment, he stated that high \\noil revenues do not directly translate to jobs, as the \\noil sector generated very few jobs. He went further to \\nstate that high revenues would only have an impact \\n\\neconomy, infrastructure, education, healthcare, and \\nsocial protection for people who could not work.\\nThe Vice President provided four reasons for the \\nlack of appropriate use of increased revenues. First, \\ngrand corruption Œ the stealing of large portions of \\n\\nwith private individuals; the direct looting of the \\ntreasury. He elaborated that with grand corruption, \\nwhich is the redirecting of public resources to private \\nuse, resources are not available to be invested in the \\n\\nof people. He distinguished grand corruption from the \\ncorruption of poor execution of government contracts \\nand emphasised that the phenomenon as seen in the \\npresent-day Nigerian government is the direct looting \\nof the nation™s resources and simply diverting them for \\npersonal use. \\nwhich is poor investment in infrastructure and creation \\nof an enabling environment for businesses. Third, is a \\n\\nwhich would have caused and provided multiple \\nstreams of revenue. \\nHe pointed out that this is a problem both at the \\nnational and subnational level as states are heavily \\ndependent on monthly FAAC Allocation to pay their \\nworker salaries as the annual internally generated \\nrevenue (IGR) of most states cannot pay salaries \\nin one month. Nigeria™s productive economy is the \\nsum total of thirty-six states and the FCT and where \\nthe states do not have enough private, commercial \\n\\n\\n\\nin the businesses at the bottom of the pyramid Œ the \\ninformal sector and the need recognize it and invest \\nin it.34The Vice President stated that the current \\ngovernment™s approach to reversing poverty and its \\nconsequences is that, while supporting a private \\nsector-led economy, to intentionally address the \\ncreation of economic opportunities for the people \\nat the bottom of the pyramid and in addition create \\nsome jobs directly, especially for thelarge number \\nof people coming out of tertiary institutions who \\n\\nhe said that the major premise of the government™s \\neconomic model, was focused on empowering the \\njobless youths and people in extreme poverty, by a \\nmix of micro credit schemes, infrastructure support \\nfor markets and small business clusters, welfare for \\nthe most vulnerable and a direct creation of jobs on \\n\\nkey focus areas for the government:\\n1. Ensuring that at least 30% of the budget is spent \\non capital especially infrastructure. To buttress \\nthis, he referred to economics reasoning that as \\ngrowth in capital expenditure rises, unemployment \\nfalls and the human development index improves. \\nTherefore, infrastructure-based policies which will \\ninitially improve unemployment will also improve \\nthe living conditions.2. Diversifying the economy especially agriculture, \\nmining and the promotion of MSMEs\\n3. \\nfor grand corruption.\\n4. Supporting states for payments of salaries and \\nemoluments.5. A social protection program covering at least 5m \\n\\nBased on these objectives, the Vice President \\nhighlighted the government™s achievements so far, as \\nfollows:Ł Provided for 30% capital expenditure from 2016 \\ndespite earning over 60% less than in the previous \\n4 years. The government has so far invested a \\ntotal of 2.7 trillion in capital spending in rail, roads, \\npower and in gas, the highest ever in the history of \\nthe country. \\nŁ In diversifying the economy, Agriculture has been \\na major success story with increasing budgetary \\nallocation of N8.8bn in 2015 to N46.2bn in 2016 \\nand N1.03bn in the current cycle. Success stories \\nin this regard include:\\n »The Anchor Borrowers Programme which \\n\\nand under which the CBN and 13 other \\nparticipating banks have so far given credit \\ntotalling N120.6bn to 720,000 small-holder \\nfarms who cultivate 12 commodities, \\nincluding; rice, wheat, cotton, soya, cassava \\nand groundnuts across 36 states and the FCT. \\nThe Anchor Borrowers programme is also \\ndigitized, with all farmlands on the platform \\nGPRS mapped, farmer biometrics captured, \\n\\nrequired on the platform aimed at enhancing \\nvisibility and productivity of the farmers.\\n »A fertilizer programme to improve local \\nblending capacity, in collaboration with the \\nKingdom of Morocco. Currently, the country \\nhas 11 fertilizer blending plants with a \\ncapacity of 2.1 million metric tons. This has \\nled to price reduction from about N15,000 per \\nbag of fertilizer to between N5,000 to N7,000 \\nper bag. »Rice production, where, but for a few \\n\\n\\nnow down to 2% from previous position of \\nimporting $5million worth of rice every day. \\nŁ Active support to the state governments through \\nloans. Paris Club refunds owed since 2005 and \\nbudget support facilities totalling N1.9 trillion \\nhave been given to the states so that consumer \\nspending in the states does not suffer even more. \\n\\nwere owing salaries for periods ranging from 3 to \\n12 months and for most states the regular income \\nof civil servants is a critical part of the economy \\nof those states.Ł The social investment programme aimed at \\npoverty alleviation and is the largest and most \\nambitious in the history of the country. The total \\nspend in the two cycles of the programme totals \\nN250 billion. The components of the programme \\nare as follows:\\n35 »The NPower programme which is the largest \\npost-tertiary job project in Africa and under \\nwhich 500 thousand graduates have been \\nrecruited as teachers, agriculture extension \\n\\nThe last batch, comprising of 300 thousand \\ngraduates, was recruited at the end of August \\nof this year. Each of the volunteers is provided \\nwith an electronic tablet which contains \\nrelevant training materials. The device \\n\\nin a digital economy as data collectors and \\nanalysts.  »The Government Enterprise and Empowerment \\nProgramme (GEEP) which gives interest-\\nfree loans to traders and artisans. So far, \\nover 15bn in interest-free loans ranging from \\n50,000 Œ 350,000 has been disbursed to more \\nthan 300 market women, traders, artisans and \\nfarmers across the country and 56% of those \\nloans have gone to women.\\n »The Trader Moni programme, under which \\nmicrocredits are given to the bottom of the \\npyramid typically the one-table traders who \\ntypically have inventory of less than N5,000. \\nThe programme is aimed at encouraging these \\nhardworking traders to buy more, improve their \\ninventory and increase their capacity to earn. \\nUnder the scheme, the government is building \\nmicrocredits for about 2 million petty traders \\nacross the country and the scheme enables \\nthem to draw more credit if they are able to \\npay back in 6 months. In addition to this, the \\ngovernment is working with between 6 and 10 \\nbanks to enables these traders to open free \\nbank accounts in order for them to have even \\n\\nprogramme has successfully opened about \\n349,000 new bank accounts. »The Energizing Economies Project which \\nis targeted at providing infrastructure, \\nparticularly solar power for small economic \\nclusters and markets. Under this project solar \\npower was provided for over 31,000 shops \\nin Ariara market in Aba;  for 13,598 shops in \\nSabon Gari Market in Kano and almost 1,000 \\nshops in three markets in Ondo state. In total, \\nthe project has provided solar power to 81,691 \\nshops spread over 320,000 MSMEs. \\n »The Home-Grown School Feeding Programme \\nunder which a free balanced meal is provided \\nto over 9.2m children in public primary schools \\nevery day. The programme is operational in 26 \\nstates and uses local produce livestock and \\npoultry which in turn supports local agriculture \\nand provides jobs for 95,440 cooks resident in \\nvarious communities where the schools are \\nlocated. »The Provisional Cash Transfer Programmes \\nunder which N5,000 is paid monthly to the \\npoorest and most vulnerable households on \\nthe condition that they participate in some \\nnutritional and environmental activities. The \\ntarget is to cover 1 million households in the \\n\\nhave been covered so far.\\nThe Vice President concluded by stating that in \\naddition to job creation, two other issues are critical \\nto resolving the poverty problem Œ education and \\nhealth care. With respect to education, he noted that \\nimproved educational outcomes are crucial to the \\ngovernment™s overall strategy to end extreme poverty. \\nTo emphasize this, he highlighted government™s action \\nplan to tackle the educational issue in the country as \\nfollows:Ł \\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, which are the \\ntarget of school enrollment, the target of quality of \\neducation, adult literacy and the quality teaching \\nby 2020.\\nŁ Undertaking a programme to get the 9million out \\nof school children back to school. A plan that \\nneeds the full cooperation of state governments, \\nreligious authorities as well as resources to build \\nthe schools and equip them properly and pay for a \\nwide number of teachers.Ł Given achievements in technology and the \\ncountry™s rapidly increasing population, there is a \\nneed to change the substance of education and \\nthe methods by which they are taught.

This is \\nworrisome because there is no current comprehensive \\nplan to address this problem. More worrisome is \\nthe fact that ﬁonly about 1% of the current Nigerian \\npopulation is enrolled in the university system - one of \\n\\n(representative of the Hon. Minister of Education and \\nserving Executive Secretary, National Universities \\nCommission).With only 264 universities in Nigeria catering for \\naround 2 million students (500,000 of these students \\nare enrolled in the National Open University (NOUN) \\nalone), there is an urgent need to address the \\nchallenge of capacity and approach. E-learning has \\n\\nmethod of reaching more learners at a lower cost \\nand with recent, dynamic, relevant and, cutting-edge \\ncurricula and skills needed in today™s workplace; \\nand for today™s workforce. Additionally, e-learning \\nempowers the learner to self-direct learning. However, \\nfor e-learning to be effective, its content should be \\nrelevant, standardized and up-to-date. \\nIssues and ChallengesAn opportunistic/political approach to addressing the \\nproblems bedeviling the education sector in Nigeria.  \\nOver the years, several government initiatives \\nhave been put in place to address the problems of \\neducational development challenges in Nigeria. There \\nhave also been several private sector driven initiatives \\nand intervention from international agencies aimed \\nat addressing the problem. However, these initiatives \\nhave failed to provide a robust and holistic strategy \\nto address the underlying problems of education in \\nNigeria. For instance;\\n »Unemployment is on the increase. \\n »Majority of Nigerian graduates are \\nunemployable - they lack skills needed for \\ntoday™s workplace.\\n »Basic technical skills (nanny, bricklayers, tilers, \\nhoteliers, caterers etc.) are being imported \\ninto Nigeria from other neighbouring African \\ncountries and Asia. »There is currently no clear national job plan.\\n »Lack of a functional and inclusive think-tank \\nresponsible for addressing the problems of \\neducation. \\nof government support for private sector driven \\ninitiatives\\nTechnology experts as well as learning professionals \\noften encounter several bottlenecks interacting with \\ngovernment as there are no clear-cut mandates as to \\nwhich agency is responsible for what in the education \\nsector.

The factors that have \\ncontributed to this problem include;\\n »Obsolete courses and/or curriculum in \\nNigerian universities.\\n »Lack of a ‚national job plan™ that projects the \\nfuture of jobs in Nigeria.\\n »Lack of technical skills to get current jobs due \\nto the abandonment of technical education.\\n »Mindset/apathy to technical education as \\nagainst university education\\n54RecommendationsAggregation of all efforts at improving education \\nin Nigeria into the current ‚NESG/NUC Strategic \\nPartnership™. \\nCurrently, there are pockets of initiatives all geared \\ntowards improving education in Nigeria either through \\ntechnology, greater inclusion, industry participation \\netc. all such efforts should be channeled through this \\nstrategic partnership.\\nState governments should participate actively in the \\npromotion of primary and secondary education within \\ntheir jurisdictions. As a federation, all state governments in Nigeria \\nhave been empowered to address the problem of \\neducation in their regions without necessarily waiting \\non the federal government. Thus, there should be an \\nenforcement mechanism in place to ensure that state \\ngovernors do not renege on this responsibility. \\nThere is a need to develop a ‚National Job Plan™.\\nThere should be a deliberate effort by the federal \\ngovernment to aggregate the jobs projection of the \\nfuture and propose the skills needed to meet the \\njob requirements.

The country \\ncurrently has an estimated 103 million internet users, \\n\\nuse this primarily to facilitate their social interactions. \\nThere is a need to convert their use of the internet and \\ntechnology devices to more productive uses that will \\naid learning, research, innovation, entrepreneurship \\netc. This would help develop the Science & Technology \\nsector of the country, which would ultimately translate \\nto higher numbers of gainfully employed youth and \\nultimately a reduction in social ills. \\nCurrent internet penetration levels can be leveraged \\nto aid learning and development. As the number of \\ntechnology services™ users increase, the demand \\nfor data services for businesses, video streaming, \\nsocial and academic use will all continue to increase \\n\\nand quality of service are key factors that need to be \\nconsidered. Broadband penetration is currently at 22% \\nwhich is below its target of 30% by the end of 2018 \\n(National Broadband Plan). There is therefore a need \\nto identify bottlenecks and gaps in the system that \\nhave slowed the pace of broadband penetration and \\naffordability.\\nIssues and ChallengesThe current broadband penetration in Nigeria is 22%, \\nfalling short of Federal Government™s 30% target by \\nthe end of 2018. A number of factors have contributed \\nto the slow pace of broadband penetration. The \\ngovernment™s current broadband plan is out of \\ndate and needs to be reviewed. The plan should be \\nfocused more on resilient technologies, ensuring that \\nour youths have adequate and affordable access to \\ndevelop their capacities and ensure their place in the \\nglobal community. \\nOutdated National Broadband Plan\\nWith a growing population and an increase in the \\nnumber of computer devices with internet capabilities, \\nthe current National Broadband plan does not take \\ninto account the new shifts in the telecommunications \\nmarket. There are currently 160 million computers in \\nNigeria; the current plan lacks a concrete strategy \\non how to leverage on the internet enabled devices \\ncurrently available to spread broadband penetration. \\nWith the plan set to expire at the end of 2018, there \\nis a need to devise a new plan that will set a higher \\nbroadband penetration target.\\n\\nright of way policy\\nThe big issue with broadband penetration across the \\n\\ncables due to the current right of way policy. Presently, \\n\\nborne by right of way charges, which are paid to the \\nvarious levels of government. The excessive right of \\nway charges substantially raises investment levels \\nrequired by telecom companies to provide broadband \\nservices and ultimately leads to high data prices for \\nthe consumer. These prices have to be harmonized \\nacross the country if broadband penetration is to be \\nsustainably expanded. Inadequate access to affordable broadband by \\neducational institutionsThere are presently two million students currently \\n\\nhundred thousand of them currently in The National \\nOpen University of Nigeria (NOUN). The government \\ndoes not provide adequate subsidies for the provision \\nof broadband connectivity to educational institutions \\nand hence the current pricing for broadband access \\nin schools is unsustainable and needs to be urgently \\nreviewed.\\n58Recommendations\\nPlan to ensure broadband penetration to at least 80% \\nof the population. \\n\\nThe federal government should have a national \\nstrategy that is technology driven and the backbone \\nof this technology will be broadband connectivity. \\nTo have a strong economy, a new 5-year National \\nBroadband Plan needs to be developed. The new plan \\nwill target 80% of the population by the end of 2023. \\nTo achieve this target, the federal government must \\n\\nbased broadband technologies should be utilised. As \\nsupply is created, demand should be simultaneously \\ndeveloped by making broadband access affordable.\\nDevelop a new policy on open access enabling \\n\\nthereby enabling cost savings. \\nTo expand broadband access in urban and rural \\nareas in the country, an effective open access model \\nneeds to be developed and effectively implemented, \\nenabling telecom organisations to share broadband \\ninfrastructure. This would help to bridge the current \\nbroadband supply gap and deliver fast and reliable \\nbroadband services to households and businesses \\nacross Nigeria. \\nReview current right of way and multiple taxation \\npolicy \\ncountry, there needs to be a harmonization of right of \\nway costs and multiple taxation across all levels of \\ngovernment. A negotiation with the federal government, \\nstate governments and local governments should be \\ninitiated to produce a nationwide right of way pricing \\npolicy, which will reduce broadband infrastructure \\ndevelopment costs for the telecom companies. \\nFederal Government should target 30% broadband \\ncoverage for primary and secondary schools and \\n100% broadband coverage for all universities.  \\nAchieving this target will require support from the \\ngovernment in the form of broadband subsidies for \\neducational institutions. 59\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n60Date: Wednesday, October 22, 2018\\nSession: Exploiting Regional and Global Markets\\n -Local production, \\nRegional Trade and Global \\nMarkets \\nTime:2:00 Œ 4:00 p.m.Panelists/Co-Chairs: \\nŁ Mrs. Yemisi Iranloye; CEO, Psaltry International Limited\\nŁ Mr. Eze Nwakanma; Head, Agric Value Chain Finance \\n& Investment Services, Nigeria Incentive-based Risk \\nSharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL)\\nŁ Mr. Debo Abodunrin; CEO, AgroPlus Africa Systems \\nLimitedModerated by:\\nŁ Mr. Sadiq Usman; Deputy COO, Agro-Allied Division, \\nFlour Mills of Nigeria Plc.

Nigeria™s primary products are mainly \\nsold fresh in the domestic markets. The processing \\nindustry represents only a fraction of the agribusiness \\nvalue-chain. In addition, post-harvest transport and \\nstorage of crops is an important piece of the puzzle, \\nas a major proportion of losses in agriculture occurs \\nduring storage and transit. Improved back-end supply-\\nchain processes and better cold-chain facilities could \\nreduce food losses, save billions of naira annually; and \\nsecure billions of dollars in additional export revenue. \\nAcross the value-chain, several vulnerabilities arise: \\nbankability of investments in the sector; backward \\nand forward linkages; environmental factors, and \\nsupply-chain peculiarities. Summarily, Nigeria needs \\nan integrated framework for ensuring that farmers \\ncan access new markets and develop business in a \\ncoherent and sustainable manner.\\n62 »\\nagronomy and market information to farm\\n-ers: For instance, fertiliser demand outstrips \\nsupply (unlike herbicides) due to government \\ninterference in the value-chain via subsidies. \\n\\nof the sector. \\n »Nigeria is the world™s largest producer of cas\\n-sava with annual output of 45 million metric \\ntonnes, however, the country™s comparative \\nadvantage is not being translated into val\\n-ue-added products such as cassava starch, \\n\\nterms of exports, the country is competitively \\nconstrained, as production of cassava is still \\nat the subsistence level. \\n »Aggregating and clustering cassava produc\\n-\\nwidely-dispersed nature of cassava-growing \\nfarms) and thereby limits the potential of \\nshoring up huge pool of reserves for process\\n-ing and exports. \\n »Lack of business approach to farming.

The industry is the fastest \\ngrowing sector in many economies even in times of \\nrecession. In 2017, the sector contributed ~6% to U.K™s \\nGDP which represents about one third of Nigeria™s GDP. \\nNigeria™s national accounts rebasing in 2014 revealed \\nthat motion pictures, sound recording and music \\nproduction alone, account for 1.42% of our GDP. In \\nthe past two years, while the entire economy plunged \\ninto recession, the Arts, Entertainment and Recreation \\nSector recorded a growth of 3.72% (2016) and 4.72% \\n(2017).

First, and most widely used, \\nare fossil fuels. The second is nuclear energy; the third \\nand widely considered best of all options, is the use of \\nless expensive renewable sources such as solar, wind \\n\\n »The discord that arise in discussions on eco\\n-nomic growth, environmental sustainability \\nand government are quite unfortunate. Those \\nwho call for environmental sustainability are \\nseen as activists, those (businesses) who \\ndrive economic growth are seen as capitalists \\nand others, such as the government, are seen \\nto be playing a game of convenience.\\n »There is however urgent need to remove this \\ndivision, as sustainability is pertinent to all \\nand is in fact, important to keeping business\\n-es viable in the long run. »Notably, technology solutions for solar pow\\n-er have improved tremendously and have be\\n-come cheaper over time, making it the right \\ntime to begin transition to renewable energy.\\nGovernment effort on the grid may be a more long-\\nterm approach to resolving Nigeria™s energy gap, \\nimmediate action must thus be taken to transition to \\nalternatives\\nToday the grid is unable to transmit power in excess of \\n5000 MW. This is less than 5% of national requirement. \\nThe timeline and path to resolving this issue is not ex\\n-pected to be short term, considering vested interests \\nin the sector from generation companies (Gencos) \\nand electricity distribution companies (Discos), who \\nhave made large investments in the sector. Overall, \\nthe key issue is to decide if we are going to remain in \\ndarkness or continue to utilise fuel generators that are \\ncostly and damaging to the environment?\\nSlow take-off of renewable energy solutions \\n\\n\\n\\ngain wide reach due to the comparatively large capital \\ninvestment required upfront to set up the infrastruc\\n-ture. This is a major deterrent for many intending to \\ntransition to or invest in solar power.\\n 87Lack of trust in renewable energy solutions\\nPerceived unreliability and lack of technical expertise \\nhave also slowed down shift to solar power. This is \\nlargely due to negative experience with solar compa\\n-nies who lacked technical expertise to deliver quality \\nservice.\\nLeadership commitment to sustainability and \\nenvironmental-friendly solutions.\\nCommitment to sustainability is driven from the top, \\nthat is, by leaders, business executives and top man\\n-agement of companies. There is a great need for more \\npeople in leadership positions to lead by example and \\nthis is evidenced by Companies such as the Nigerian \\nBottling Company (NBC) that have demonstrated that \\ntheir continuing ‚green™ efforts are a product of strong \\ncommitment by global leadership. \\nMore companies need to collaborate to improve \\nimpact of sustainability initiatives\\nCompanies usually do not pool resources to make an \\nimpact but recent activities have shown that collab\\n-oration between companies, otherwise deemed as \\ncompetitors, and alliances with government is a key \\npart of transitioning to ﬁgreen™ practices. \\n »For instance, the Nigerian Bottling Company \\n(NBC)™s Food & Beverage Recycling Alliance, \\nwhich seeks to rid Nigerian waterways of \\nplastic waste, is an initiative formed between \\ncompetitors including Nigerian Breweries Plc, \\nSeven-Up Bottling and Nestle Nigeria Plc.\\n »Also, the NBC recently partnered with the \\nLagos State government to collect and recy\\n-cle plastic waste in its waterways. \\nRecommendationsShare experiences, success stories, and sensitise \\n\\nand environment-friendly practices.\\nCompanies already undertaking green solutions, such \\nas Sterling Bank, must share their experience with the \\npublic to set an example for other companies and en\\n-courage consumers to improve environment-friendly \\nbehaviour.\\nPrivate sector players must take the lead in the \\ntransition to better sustainability practices\\nCompanies must take the lead by disconnecting from \\nthe national grid and moving to renewable energy; \\nthereby allowing unused capacity to be supplied to \\nless-privileged communities.Connect remote off-grid communities, where energy \\ndemand is low, to renewable energy solutions. \\nTransition areas, such as industrial hubs or SME \\nclusters, to renewable energy sources to demonstrate \\nscalability and drive investment therein.\\nBusinesses and SMEs clustered in urban areas can \\npursue ‚communal™ solar solutions.

Ensuring sustainable \\nbusiness practices is now a top agenda for business \\nleaders, world leaders, environmental activists and \\nother key stakeholders. However, business entities \\nrequire support and incentives from regulators. \\nThis is to encourage the inculcation of innovation in \\nbusiness operations and to promote environmentally \\n\\nbusiness growth.\\nIssues and ChallengesProtective regulatory interventions facilitating \\nThe core of government incentives and policies is to \\ndrive healthy market competitiveness that improves \\n\\nCurrent regulatory interventions however promote \\n\\npractices in such areas as materials sourcing, \\n\\npolicies and/or incentives favour a small group of the \\npopulation, reap off the system and make development \\nand growth elude majority of the populace. For \\ninstance, in Rwanda, government policies effectively \\neliminated deadweight loss associated with goods \\ntransport by shortening transit time of containers \\nfrom Mombasa to Kigali from 22 days to 5 days. \\nSimilarly, Singaporean port discharges 118 ships in 14 \\nhours whereas Nigerian port discharges 64 ships in 39 \\nhours. The instances provided indicate the power of \\nenacting the right policies to facilitate ease of doing \\nbusiness.Fragmented approach to tackling sustainability \\nchallenges Environmental protection is a holistic endeavour \\nrequiring stakeholder collaboration. However, a \\ndichotomy presently exists between the State and the \\nPrivate Sector. The former and latter sit on opposite \\nsides of the table with the regulator acting as the \\nhunter and the businesses as the hunted. Business \\nowners do not openly collaborate with the government \\nto address the issue of sustainability holistically. Also, \\ncollaboration amongst businesses are limited. \\nLimited public education and buy-in on environmental \\nissuesPublic enlightenment on ecosystem preservation \\nand sustainable resource exploitation is almost non-\\nexistent. Hence, the populace are ignorant on the \\nimpact of their activities on the environment.\\nOver-regulation\\nBio resources are not fully exploited in Nigeria because \\nof over-regulation.

Although Public institutions do \\nnot formulate policies, they implement them. They \\nplay critical role in determining what will get done \\nand ensure through execution that policy decisions \\nare translated to impact. However, effective public \\ninstitutions have failed to emerge in Nigeria and the \\nconsequences of well-intended policies are absent. \\nHow do we reverse the trend?\\nThe Nigerian government has developed the Federal \\nCivil Service Strategic Plan (2016-2020), which was \\ninternally generated by key stakeholders in the sector. \\nIt is tailored towards ensuring that the public service is \\n\\n »To develop an institutionalised and ethical \\ncivil service\\n »To develop and institutionalise an enterprise \\ncontent management system »To change the orientation of the service\\n »To develop an entrepreneurial culture within \\nthe service\\nIssues and ChallengesCorrelation between Economic Performance and \\nQuality of Governance\\nThere is a correlation between high quality public \\ninstitutions and the proper functioning of the economy. \\nThe poor state of the public service in Nigeria affects \\nthe economy because empirical evidence have shown \\n\\neffectiveness of the civil service and the productivity \\nof the economy. \\nDecline in the Quality and Effectiveness of Public \\nService\\nIn the 1960s, Nigeria had a reputation for high \\nquality of governance among the Commonwealth \\nNations.

An effec\\n-tive Performance Management process es\\n-tablishes the groundwork for excellence and \\nthe absence of such within the public service \\nhas hindered performance.

Yet, combined total for unemployment \\nand underemployment increased from 37.2% in Q2 \\n2017 to 40.0% in Q3 2017 (NBS). Since 1999, suc\\n-cessive governments have formulated numerous de\\n-velopment initiatives geared at delivering sustainable \\neconomic opportunities and growth, yet none of them \\nhave fully delivered on their objectives. These past \\neconomic plans have not fully yielded positive fruit in \\naccelerating development and accruing the dividends \\nof economic growth. The challenge lies in governance \\nŒ execution and implementation.\\nNigeria™s population is growing exponentially. Over 1.5 \\nmillion candidates seek admission to Nigerian univer\\n-sities, with about 33% success rate annually.

However, these \\nplans and strategies have failed to translate into im\\n-proved access to economic opportunities and reduc\\n-tion in poverty.\\nThis persistent gap between economic policies and \\nstrategies and economic development can be attribut\\n-ed to three key points: Inadequate understanding of \\nNigeria™s economic problems by policy-makers, poor \\nimplementation of economic policies and strategies \\nand lack of collective action of critical stakeholders to \\ndrive economic growth and development.\\n »The poor implementation of economic poli\\n-cies and strategies by the public sector can \\nbe attributed to lack of skilled public policy re\\n-sources within the civil service. This skill gap \\nis further worsened by inability of civil service \\nto attract public policy talent due to its poor \\nreward system.\\n »Collective action is the ability of large groups \\nof people to begin a movement for a com\\n-mon good.

Today, Governments \\nall over the world are utilising the internet (World Wide \\nWeb) to engage citizens. In the same way, citizens are \\nusing social media platforms to exercise their rights \\nand demand for the dividends of democracy. In Nigeria, \\ndespite being the 8th largest country in the world in \\nterms of internet penetration, citizen participation \\nin the country remains low. This is evident in a 2018 \\nranking of countries on e-government development \\nin which Nigeria was ranked 143 out of 193 on the \\nE-Government Development Index, which measures \\ncountries™ use of information and communications \\ntechnologies to deliver public services. For a \\nsociety that is getting more interconnected through \\ntechnology, Nigerians are often disconnected from \\npolicy decisions that shape and impact their lives. \\nTo achieve improved citizen participation and \\nengagement, Nigeria requires an informed citizenry, \\nan organised civil society and collaboration between \\nthe public and private sector and civil societies.\\nIssues and ChallengesLack of awareness on existing Government platforms \\nand initiatives that support citizen™s participation \\nand lack of citizen engagement in developing these \\nplatforms and initiatives.\\nThe Federal Government has developed some \\nplatforms to engage citizens such as the e-participation \\n\\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation. \\nHowever, awareness/publicity and the extent of \\nGovernment engagement with citizen™s for their input \\nbefore developing such platforms has been poor.\\n »A quick survey of the panellists and participants \\nat the plenary session revealed little or no \\nawareness of the e-participation platform \\n(www.osg.gov.ng or www.eparticipation.gov.\\nng) recently launched. \\n »The information on usage statistics (17 users) \\navailable on the portal also corroborated \\ndiscussions on poor publicity, awareness and \\ncitizen engagement.\\n »Lack of engagement with citizens on their \\nneeds and the lack of collaboration with \\nState and Local Government in the design \\nand development of any citizen engagement \\nplatform also contributes to poor awareness \\nand publicity.\\n »In addition, MDAs unawareness on the \\nexistence of such platforms and the inability \\nto hold persons responsible in cases of non-\\nresponse to complaints and requests inhibits \\nthe likelihood of success of such platforms.\\nInadequate demands from citizens for their rights.\\nNigerian citizens are not doing enough in demanding \\n\\nservants accountable.\\n »Citizens neither know nor understand their \\nrights making them unable to demand for \\nwhat is rightfully theirs.

As of 2017, Nigeria was \\nranked 152 among the 188 UN member states in the \\nHuman Development Index, HDI. Prior to the decline \\nin global oil prices, Nigeria was growing at a CAGR of \\n5.3% post rebasing, yet this growth did not translate \\ninto sustainable human development. Today, Nigeria \\nranks as one of the countries with the highest number \\nof maternal, infant and child mortality; this is to the \\nextent of losing 1 in every 13 expectant mothers, \\nwhich is partly driven by inadequate manpower. To \\ncomplement the statistics Nigeria also ranks as the \\ncountry with one of the highest malnourished children \\nglobally. According to UNICEF, Nigeria has the highest \\nnumber of out of school youth in the world: over ten \\nmillion Nigerian youth do not go to school. \\nThe country™s infrastructure gap is wide and continues \\nto expand as the population increases. It is also \\nestimated that there are presently only 30 million seats \\navailable in Nigeria™s primary and secondary schools \\nto accommodate it™s 90 million youth under the age \\nof 17 and a mere 1% of the population is currently \\n\\nin the rising level of food insecurity, income poverty \\nand insecurity in the country, it further stresses the \\n\\nbut human resources and its management. With the \\nright institutional framework, social consciousness \\nfor the citizenry and an empowered social population, \\nNigeria™s social problems can be tackled. Why has \\ninclusive growth failed despite the intent and what are \\nthe new solutions to ensure that every development \\ninvestment delivers for the people? \\nIssues and ChallengesPopulation growth currently outpaces economic \\ngrowth which has undermined several poverty \\nreduction efforts \\nBy virtue of its burgeoning population, which has been \\nestimated to grow at an annual rate of 2.6%, the slow \\npace of Nigeria™s economic growth has placed a huge \\nstrain on the limited resources available to cater to \\nthe welfare of the populace. This has also crippled \\nthe impact of several poverty alleviation measures \\nand initiatives which have been implemented by \\nthe government and international development \\norganizations over the past few years.\\nNigeria™s low score on the Human Capital Index \\nNigeria™s human capital index score which was \\nmeasured across survival, schooling and health, is \\n\\nquality health care and education to its citizens. This \\nis of particular concern, as the quality of services \\nprovided by the government in this regard play a critical \\nrole in ensuring the social welfare of its citizens, as \\nwell engendering inclusive economic development.\\nMassive backlog of investment in health and \\neducation infrastructure \\n\\nproper health and education infrastructure by the \\ngovernment is long overdue. Despite several initiatives \\nwhich have been undertaken to ensure that both \\n\\n\\ngap between infrastructural needs of the sectors and \\ncurrent infrastructural capacity.\\nNigeria has the largest number of out-of-school \\nchildren in the world\\nThe rate of pupil enrollment in primary and secondary \\nschools in Nigeria has not been impressive.

In July 2018, the Central Bank of \\nNigeria (CBN) reported that Nigeria was not on track to \\nmeet the 2020 targets set out in the National Financial \\nInclusion Strategy (NFIS) of 2012. The impediments to \\nachieving this target have been ascribed to economic \\nconstraints, insecurity issues in the northern part of \\nNigeria, obsolete strategies, among others. In order to \\n\\nwere initiated such as reducing the Know Your \\nCustomer (KYC) barriers to opening and operating a \\nbank account, creating a conducive environment for \\n\\nof agent networks with nationwide reach.

Such projects can generate about \\n4.4 gigawatts per year over the next 10 years, which \\ncan potentially satisfy about 30% of Nigeria™s electricity \\ndemand. Various Development Finance Institutions \\nand Multilateral Agencies suggest that over US$250 \\nmillion (NGN90 billion) is currently available in \\n\\n\\nmarket is rapidly moving away from humanitarian \\ninterventions towards private debt and equity capital, \\nand Nigeria has enormous market potential to support \\nsuch growth. \\nToday, over 90 million Nigerians are without access \\n\\nrate. Mini-grids circumvent many of the problems \\nassociated with electricity from the centralised \\ngrid, while also providing clean and reliable power. \\nAdditionally, mini-grids provide a cost-effective \\n\\ncould help businesses tap into a revenue opportunity \\nof up to NGN2.8 trillion (US$8 billion) per year.\\nThe NESG and Rocky Mountain Institute co-authored \\na Report entitled ‚Mini-grid Investment Report: \\nScaling the Nigerian Market™, which illuminates the \\ncurrent state of the Nigerian mini-grid market and the \\nopportunities for investment as well as the current \\nopportunities and challenges to scaling the market. \\nThe report equally offers recommended best practices, \\nthat when incorporated into future projects further \\nensures commercial success both from a business \\nand developmental perspective. \\nThe Mini-Grid Investment Report was launched at \\na Breakfast Meeting on ﬁFinancing Off-Grid Energy \\nProjectsﬂ by the Permanent Secretary (Power) in the \\nFederal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing, Mr. \\nLouis Edozien (on behalf of the Federal Government \\nof Nigeria) and a Member of the Board of Nigerian \\nEconomic Summit Group and Chairman of Phillips \\nConsulting Limited, Mr. Foluso Phillips (on behalf of \\nthe Nigerian Economic Summit Group). The Rocky \\nMountain Institute (RMI) was represented by Mr. \\nJames Sherwood. The event was organized with \\nsupport from Heinrich Böll Stitfung (HBS) Nigeria for \\nthe Nigerian Renewable Energy Roundtable (NiRER). \\nOther lead discussants at the event which was \\nfacilitated by Mr. Patrick Okigbo III (Principal Partner, \\nNextier Power) were Mr. Segun Adaju (President, \\nRenewable Energy Association of Nigeria), Mrs. Ify \\nMalo (CEO and Co-Founder, Clean Tech Hub and \\nEnergy Innovation Centre) and Mr. Bolade Soremekun \\n(Owner, Rubitec Nigeria Limited).\\n The participants highlighted several issues and \\n\\nas the ease of doing business in the renewable energy \\nspace. Import duties and customs delays increase the \\ncost and time required to construct mini-grid systems \\nand this is the experience of most developers. While \\nthe Nigerian Customs Service has clear guidelines \\non import duties for different categories of products, \\nthey have been inconsistently implemented and are \\nsubject to sudden change, impacting the effective \\ncost of hardware components. The Customs services \\nonly implement the tariff prescribed by the Federal \\nMinistry of Finance and the Federal Economic Council.  \\nThe Renewable energy space is already threatened by \\nthis imposed import duty and most investors prefer \\ninvesting in other countries, for example Kenya and \\nGhana, rather than investing in Nigeria. \\nAnother challenge is the lack of tax support incentives \\nand import duty exemption by the Federal Government. \\nTax and duty exemptions on mini-grid components \\ncan lower up-front cost for developers. Consistent \\nenforcement of such exemptions would enable more \\naccurate pricing of mini-grid systems and increase \\n\\nspeedy and reliable processing of energy system \\ncomponents, which would lower the cost of delays \\nand unexpected holding fees. The Federal Ministry of \\nFinance has not aligned itself with public and private \\nsector actors to facilitate tax breaks and expedite \\ncustoms processes. \\nThere are also litigation challenges between \\nstakeholders due to a lack of communication between \\nDiscos and the mini-grid operators on the appropriate \\nentity with the license to provide electricity to the \\ncommunity. This has affected the market because \\nboth banks and investors are scared to invest in a \\nsector where they do not know the true players in the \\nsector. \\n\\nagriculture and renewable energy. Conversations on \\nrenewable energy are usually limited to solar, but there \\nis also bioenergy, biogas and biomass and there is \\nalso a lot of opportunity for captive energy especially \\nfor agricultural processors in Nigeria. Today, a lot of \\nagricultural waste which can be used as fuel is being \\nthrown away. \\nRenewable Energy\\n123There needs to be a stronger cooperation between \\nthe agriculture sector and renewable energy sectors \\nbecause it will transform the economy and the \\n\\neducation of the sector by the local banks is a huge \\nchallenge. Since most local banks are not players \\nin the renewable energy, they have minimal or no \\nknowledge about the sector, hence afraid to lend to it.  \\nDespite these challenges, participants were optimistic \\n\\ngrid energy projects. They called on the Federal \\nGovernment to implement intervention incentives \\nin the renewable energy space while the state and \\nlocal governments were called upon to scale up their \\ninvolvement through sensitization. It is also important \\nto review the Environmental and Social Impact \\nAssessment process for renewable energy projects. \\nLocal banks were also encouraged to be educated \\nabout the renewable energy sector to allay their fears \\nabout the sector. \\n\\n\\npartial grant and operational subsidies as well as the \\n\\nit is important to co-ordinate a cross-sectoral \\nimplementation to stimulate demand. On its part, the \\nFederal Government must clarify current regulations, \\nimplement additional enabling policies, develop a \\ndata sharing platform, improve collaboration and \\ndialogues between stakeholders and encourage or \\nbuild Distribution Companies/Developer relationships. \\nIn conclusion, Nigeria should create a mini-grid \\nbusiness community consortium e.g. build a synergy \\nbetween the agricultural sector and the renewable \\nenergy space, design standardized modular mini-grid \\nsystems, improve telecom service reliability, improve \\ncustomer engagement strategies and implement \\ncost-reduction strategies.\\n124Mind the Gap: Education to Employment\\nThe reason for current high levels of unemployment in \\nNigeria is mostly attributed to the outdated curriculum \\nin the education system, which does not equip youth \\nwith the skills required by employers. There is therefore \\nan urgent need to revamp the curriculum so those \\ncurrently within the school system are appropriately \\nskilled for the labour market and to reskill the large \\npool of youth who are already out of the school system \\nand do not possess the required skills. A parallel \\nline of engagement seeks to expand the economy, \\nto create opportunities for absorbing new entrants \\ninto the labour market, focused on the demand \\nside. A crucial challenge, however, is the lack of a \\nframework to facilitate a holistic engagement, which \\nseeks to ensure seamless coordination between the \\nvarious pillars, which facilitate job creation on scale. \\nAs the Nigerian Economic Summit Group is uniquely \\npositioned to be the bridge between the activities \\non both the supply and demand sides through its \\nconvening power on various platforms, this Session \\nsought to facilitate integration and a collaborative \\napproach between academia, government, the \\nprivate sector and development partners to develop \\nsustainable solutions to tackle unemployment and \\nunderemployment in Nigeria.\\nThe Breakfast Meeting on ﬁMind the Gap: Education to \\nEmploymentﬂ hosted in partnership with the Nigerian \\nUniversities Commission (NUC) was at facilitating \\nan integrated and collaborative approach between \\nacademia, government, the private sector and \\ndevelopment partners to develop sustainable solutions \\nto tackle unemployment and underemployment in \\nNigeria. The Meeting was also convened to formalise \\nthe collaboration between the public and private \\nsector on skills development through a Memorandum \\nof Understanding between the NESG and the NUC. \\nAmong the participants were Senator (Dr.) Chris Ngige \\n(Honourable Minister for Labour and Employment), Mr. \\nRoti Balogun (Chief Organisation, Talent and Learning \\n\\n\\nOlatunde Adekola (Senior Education Specialist, Africa \\nRegion, World Bank), Mr. Sambou Coly (Programme \\nManager, Mastercard Foundation), Mr. Peter Bamkole \\n(Director, Enterprise Development Centre). \\nThe CEO of Siemens Nigeria Limited, Mrs. Onyeche \\nTifase was represented by Inna Belozerskikh. The \\nMeeting was facilitated by the Facilitator of NESG \\nHuman Capital Development Policy Commission and \\nCEO of Cognity Advisory Limited, Mr. Tope Toogun, \\nDuring the Meeting, and there were presentations \\nof good practice and private sector supported \\ndevelopment interventions on youth employment \\nand skills development. The African Development \\nBank recognises that youth unemployment is one of \\nthe biggest challenges facing Africa and Nigeria with \\nunemployment rate in the country at 18.8%. Among the \\n\\nas combined unemployment and underemployment \\nrate gross 22.64 million individuals, translating to \\n52.65% of the entire youth labour force. It is in this \\nregard that the Bank has therefore developed its ‚Jobs \\nfor Youth in Africa™ Strategy to create 25 million new \\njobs and empower 50 million youth in Africa within \\n10 years (2016-2025). The Bank in partnership with \\nkey stakeholders has initiated projects in Nigeria \\nthat are designed to address the challenge of youth \\nunemployment in Nigeria. Amongst these projects \\nare the ‚Coding for Employment™ program designed to \\n\\nacross Nigeria; and the ‚Staple Crop Processing Zone™ \\nproject. \\nThese projects cut across technology and agriculture \\nrespectively. The Bank seeks to work with and \\ncollaborate with private sector through program \\ndesign, incubation and knowledge generation, resource \\nmobilisation, job linkages and advisory support. In \\norder to support the private sector, the Bank provides \\n\\nand equity investments. The Bank also works with \\ngovernments to improve the enabling environment \\nand increase the ease of doing business in Nigeria. On \\nits part, GE Nigeria believes in developing the skills of \\nyoung Nigerians and has undertaken two programs that \\n\\nthe Business Entrepreneurship Program which targets \\nuniversity students to simulate business situations \\nand train their teachers on elements to observe and \\nsupport students with. Also, in partnership with the \\nInternational Labour Organisation (ILO), GE funded the \\n‚Start and Improve your Business program™. \\nThese programmes train National Youth Service \\nCorps (NYSC) members, who go on to train young \\nentrepreneurs in developing their businesses. \\nThe Mastercard Foundation is one of the largest \\nfoundations in the world with an endowment of \\n$20 billion. The Foundation has a focus on youth \\n\\n\\n125The Foundation has a goal to create jobs for 30 million \\n\\nto six million jobs with a focus on agriculture and \\ncreative industries. The Foundation seeks to work in \\ncollaboration with all partners to achieve this goal. \\nSiemens Nigeria Limited has been conducting massive \\ntraining interventions for youth in Nigeria around the \\n\\nand Mathematics (STEM). Siemens Nigeria Limited is \\nwilling to engage and partner with the NUC and the \\nFederal Ministry of Education on scaling up its skills \\ndevelopment interventions.\\nDuring the discussions, participants noted the \\nlimited industry experience within the academia or \\nknowledge society. Many of the lecturers in different \\n\\noutside the class room hence they lack the required \\nknowledge of the industry. As a result, they do not \\npossess the necessary capacity to prepare the labour \\nforce for that sector. Most members of the Academia \\nspend their yearlong sabbatical leave in another \\nclass room instead of taking the opportunity to gain \\nsome experiential knowledge from the private sector \\nthus limiting their capacity to prepare students for \\nthe labour market. This leaves a huge gap between \\ngraduate capacity and employability. \\nThere is also inadequate capacity of the Nigerian \\nUniversity System to absorb aspiring university \\napplicants. Nigeria currently has 164 universities, \\n75 of which are private institutions. Total enrolment \\nin the universities is about 2 million students, with \\na graduation rate of 400,000 students per year. \\nGiven the national population of 190m, the ratio of \\nstudents to the national population is too minimal. \\nAnnually, about 1.7m Œ 1.9m young people write the \\nJoint Administration Matriculation Board (JAMB) \\nexaminations hoping to gain admission into these \\nUniversities. Out of this number only about 500,000 \\ngain admission Œ this is based on the capacity of the \\nuniversities and not due to failure rates. This means \\nthat every year over 1m applicants from ages 16-25 \\nyears are disappointed and frustrated as they did not \\nget into universities. \\nAnother major challenge is that Nigerian graduates \\nare ill-prepared for the labour market and are not \\nglobally competitive due to low standard of education \\nas many leave the university system half-baked, not \\nready for the labour market because current university \\ncurriculum is outdated and not adequately linked to \\nindustry requirements so Nigerian graduates cannot \\ncompete with their counterparts in the rest of the \\nworld due to the low standard of education. Nigeria \\n\\nguarantees investment in graduates after they leave \\nthe universities system. The private sector invests in \\nat least six months on the job training for new entrants \\ninto the labour force. Such investment can be re-\\nchannelled into some months of training of students \\nin the university system before their graduation and \\nthereby reduce the cost of recruitment and on the \\njob training.  Worse still, different stakeholders are \\ncurrently implementing interventions in silos leading to \\na lack of collaboration and synergy in the development \\nof solutions for skills development. Presently, we lack \\na collaborative model between Academia, Government \\nand Private sector to develop solutions to bridge \\nknowledge and skills gaps. The urgency to support \\njob creation in Nigeria must be accompanied with the \\nright synergies, as these problems cannot be solved \\nin silos. As a result, Nigeria is currently experiencing \\nsymptoms of the effects of youth unemployment \\nthrough security challenges such as separatist \\nmovements, insurgencies, militancy attacks and \\nfarmer/herdsmen clashes.\\nThe good news is that the NUC has initiated an \\nambitious reform agenda to review the education \\nsystem. The reform agenda consists of about 10 -11 \\nimportant votes most important of which are the issues \\nof widening access to higher education for young \\npeople, deepening the quality of education system, \\nand re-engineering the curriculum of universities to \\nalign to the needs of the industries. However, the NUC \\nshould collaborate with the private sector to ensure \\nthere is input from industries in shaping the reform \\nagenda.It is the view of participants that issues around \\nunemployment and unavailability of certain skill \\nset in the labour market cannot be resolved without \\naddressing accountability, leadership and incentives. \\nThe issues of accountability as it relates to the lack \\nof data to justify level of accountability is required \\nto create synergy between the demand side and \\nthe supply from the university, thus there is a large \\ndisconnect linking the product of the overall plan \\nof the economy which is to drive the non-oil sector \\ngrowth. People should be held accountable for their \\nresponsibilities and actions. However, there is limited \\ndata to understand performance, or hold people \\n\\ntrack performance. Also, leadership of the universities \\nand Governing Councils ought to be those who can \\ncreate jobs and ensure productivity of human capital \\ndevelopment while incentives for the universities and \\nacademia should be top priority to get the best out of \\nthe system by linking resources to result. \\n126The participants also proposed the deployment of \\na Triple Helix model to urgently reform the Nigerian \\nEducation System and revamp the academic \\ncurriculum of our tertiary institution so that those \\ncurrently in school system will be equipped with skills \\nrelevant to the labour market demands and also reskill \\nthe large pool of youth who are already out of school \\nwho do not possess the required skillset needed. The \\nNUC was urged to review the obsolete educational \\ncurriculum in the university system to a scale that \\nmeets the demands of industries in a 21st century \\neconomy. There is also a need to adopt a radical \\napproach to change the narratives of the education \\nsystem in Nigeria to ensure that young people become \\nglobally competitive and obtain relevant education. If \\nall actors in the space require change, there is a need \\nto work together to address issues in a comprehensive \\nway. We need to form a coalition and collaboration of \\ninterested parties that would bring both government \\nand private sector to work together in changing the \\nstatus-quo.It was also recommended that a team be constituted \\nimmediately consisting of NUC and NESG \\nrepresentatives to review the Report of the 20th \\nNigerian Economic Summit held in year 2014 that \\nwas devoted to ﬁTransforming Education through \\nPartnerships for Global Competitivenessﬂ and NESG \\nwas requested to lead a team to mobilize needed \\nprivate sector resources for successful execution of \\n\\nduring the Meeting. In this regard, Nigeria must \\ndevelop a road map that will identify a set of long-\\nterm interventions to tackle issues on unemployment. \\nThis should be done through a tripartite partnership \\nbetween NESG, Federal Ministry of Labour and \\nEmployment and the African Development Bank \\n(AfDB). The participants committed to convene a \\ndedicated Job Creation Summit in 2019 subsequently \\nannually thereafter with target audience consisting of \\ngraduates, the academia, government and the private \\nsector.\\nA key outcome of the Meeting was Memorandum \\nof Understanding (MoU) signed between the \\nNigerian Economic Summit Group and the National \\nUniversities Commission. It was signed by Prof. \\nAbubakar Adamu Rasheed mni (Executive Secretary, \\nNational Universities Commission) and Mr. ‚Laoye \\nJaiyeola (CEO, Nigerian Economic Summit Group). \\nThe MoU creates a collaborative framework for the \\ndesign of solutions that strategically drive effective \\ndevelopment of a productive university system that \\nguarantees quality and relevant education for national \\ndevelopment and a globally competitive economy.\\nThe agreed focus of the collaboration between NESG \\nand NUC are to deploy the ‚Triple Helix Model™ of \\nAcademia-Industry-Government to develop a university \\neducation reform agenda that will deliver a productive \\nuniversity system that guarantees quality and relevant \\ntertiary education for national development and global \\ncompetitiveness; mobilize private sector support and \\nresources to develop and fund solutions on issues \\nsuch as building employability and entrepreneurial \\nskills of university students, skills development, job \\ncreation, and business development for Nigerian \\nUniversities; design a new Nigerian University System \\nmodel that closes the gap between theoretical and \\nthe experiential learning, making higher education \\nmore demand-led; and create a Roundtable/Platform \\nat the annual Nigerian Economic Summits, which will \\nbe dedicated to the academia for useful interactions \\nbetween the government, academia and the private \\nsector. The establishment of synergy or collaborative \\nframework between stakeholders in the private and \\npublic sector in the development of sustainable \\nsolutions through this Memorandum of Understanding \\n(MOU) a welcome development.\\n127Incentivising Investment in the Health Care Sector in Nigeria\\nThe National Policy on Incentivizing Health Care \\nInvestment was developed by the Federal Ministry of \\nHealth in 2016. The principle of the policy is to promote \\nand facilitate domestic and international investment \\nin the healthcare sector in Nigeria to make quality \\nhealthcare services and products available to more \\nNigerians. To this end, the focus of this Roundtable \\non ﬁIncentivising Investment in the Health Care Sector \\nin Nigeriaﬂ hosted in partnership with Development \\nAlternatives Incorporated (DAI) was on overcoming \\neconomic barriers in investing in the healthcare sector \\nto promote universal health care and comprehensive \\nquality services to all citizens that would make a \\npositive impact in their lives and promote Nigerian \\neconomy. The objective was to promote and foster \\nboth domestic and international investments in the \\nNigerian healthcare sector, increase the capacity \\nto deliver more quality services in Nigeria and \\ndeliberate on ways to improve the healthcare business \\nenvironment.\\nThe panellists included Prof. Isaac Adewole \\n(Honourable Minister for Health), H.E. Mrs. Toyin \\nSaraki (Founder/President, Wellbeing Foundation \\nAfrica), Dr. Olumide Okunola (Senior Health Specialist, \\nInternational Finance Corporation) and Dr. Kanyinsola \\nOyeyinka (Healthcare Investment Adviser, Nigeria \\nSovereign Investments Authority) and it was moderated \\nby a Public Health Specialist, Mr. Ben Iyanle. \\nThe panellists and participants agreed that it is not the \\ngovernment™s best use of funds to build infrastructure \\nbut rather to create an enabling environment for the \\nprivate sector to build and monitor. Unfortunately, \\nthere are little or no incentives available to encourage \\n\\nincentives to grant loan facilities as the healthcare \\nsector as it is currently set up, does not bring quick \\nreturns on investment. Also, the Federal and State \\nMinistries of Health should enforce healthcare rules \\nand guidelines on standardization for hospitals and \\nall healthcare centres in Nigeria. There is a lack of \\nstandardization of healthcare professionals - for \\ninstance, there is no distinction between a nurse \\nand a midwife. There is a lack of continuation when \\nthere is an administrative change, and this hinders the \\ndevelopment of the sector. The National Healthcare \\nAct of 2014 states that healthcare facilities must \\n\\ncontinue operation and these requirements must be \\n\\nevidence that any compliance audit has been carried \\nout to ensure this. \\nIt was also noted that the Federal Government of \\nNigeria (FGN) has little control over the quality and \\nstandardization of healthcare facilities as it is the \\nstate governments that register them and the FGN \\ncannot legislate over them. This makes monitoring \\nof health standards a concurrent risk. The state \\ngovernments are neither investing in healthcare nor \\nemploying doctors and nurses. The original plan with \\nincentives was that the FGN formulates and initially \\nfunds incentives and then the state governments \\ntake over, but this has not been the case thus far. \\nUnfortunately, both the state and local governments \\nhave not adequately played their constitutional \\nroles in implementing these incentives. Another \\nmajor challenge is the inadequacies in the capacity \\ndevelopment of healthcare professionals. Healthcare \\nprofessionals require constant training and capacity \\nbuilding to keep up with the ever-increasing demand \\nand advancements in healthcare. For instance, in the \\nnursing profession, there is a generalist approach \\ninstead of having nurses specialized in key areas of \\nmedicine and thereby reducing the pressure on doctors \\nand subsequently lead to a demand for nurses. We \\nalso have a disproportionate distribution of healthcare \\nprofessionals and facilities in the country. Majority \\nof both healthcare professionals and facilities are \\nin urban areas rather than the rural areas where the \\ndemand for these services is greater. Even in the urban \\nareas, there is a greater concentration in Lagos State \\nand Abuja than any other location. This has also led \\nto an increase in the cost of treatment and mortality \\nrate. A key factor in the disparity is the security threat \\nmedical personnel face in certain areas. The wave of \\ninsecurity currently gripping the nation has rendered \\nsome states in the country virtually isolated from \\nprimary healthcare. Finally, the Roundtable panellists \\nand participants pointed out the lack of comprehensive \\ndatabase as critical. A lot of Nigerians are unaware \\nthat certain services are rendered in the country and \\nthis is because health information is available in silos \\nand due to the Medical and Dental Association™s by-\\nlaw of its members not advertising. \\nHealth Care\\n128To incentivize investment in the health care sector in \\nNigeria, government-led incentives were proposed. The \\nNigerian government lacks the capacity to holistically \\ncater for the sector and it should not keep spending \\nmoney just building infrastructures. However, it can \\ntake the lead by providing a favourable environment for \\ninvestors to participate in the provision of healthcare \\nservices. \\nOne such consideration is tiered geographical \\nincentives, based on the Indian model in which \\nthe government increases the incentives based on \\nvulnerability of the region. In other words, the worse \\noff a community is, the better the incentive to help \\nsuch a community gets. Another is public private \\npartnerships. Like the power and transportation \\nsectors, the government would need to create \\n\\ninvestors. The Roundtable also called for better \\nalignment between the three tiers of government in \\nareas such as standardization and regulation. It was \\nnoted that since the state and local governments \\nare responsible for regulating healthcare facilities in \\ntheir respective sub-nationals, so it is necessary for \\nboth governments to work together and ensure the \\nregulations as stated in the National Health Care Act \\nare strictly enforced. It is also important for all tiers \\nof government to work together to combat insecurity \\nin the country to create an enabling environment for \\nhealthcare sector\\nAnother key recommendation is a focus on non-\\ncommunicable diseases (NCDs) as part of the primary \\nhealthcare framework. Primary health care has \\nprimarily focused on communicable diseases such \\nas malaria, cholera and so on. With the increase in \\nmortality rates in non-communicable diseases such as \\nheart disease, renal disease and cancer, it has become \\nnecessary to expand healthcare to accommodate \\nthese health issues. As follow-up to this there should \\nalso be a focus on preventive healthcare rather than \\ncurative or emergency healthcare. Due to increasing \\nhealth costs, Nigerians do not engage in preventive \\nhealthcare and rather resort to emergency healthcare. \\nFor instance, proper antenatal care will help to reduce \\nchild and mother mortality rates. \\nTo promote faith in the sector which will in turn lead \\nto more investment in the sector, the Roundtable \\ncalled on governments to facilitate proper database \\nmanagement and information dissemination because \\nthere needs to be consolidated information of the \\nservices available, locations and the success stories \\nof the sector. In addition, there is the need to ensure \\ncontinuation of policies from previous administrations \\nthat were effective and the conversations around \\nimproving the sector need to be taken out of Lagos and \\nAbuja to other States in the form of town hall meetings \\nand dialogues. This will ensure that the concerns of all \\nthe citizenry are adequately captured.\\nIn concluding, panellists and participants \\nrecommended a reform of the National Health \\nInsurance Scheme (NHIS). The NHIS was designed \\nto initially attain a coverage of 300,000 civil servants \\nwithin a four-year period. The Scheme was primarily \\ndesigned as a point of care service to cater for 3 \\n\\nand transformation to take into consideration the \\nneeds of a growing population.\\n129Leveraging Domestic Resource Mobilisation for Sustainable Development\\nNigeria™s revenues have historically been low and \\noverly dependent on the oil sector. The International \\nMonetary Fund (IMF) estimates that revenue collected \\nin 2016 across all tiers of government was only about \\n6% of GDP. Historically, more than 70% of those \\nrevenues have come from the oil sector while the non-\\noil sectors, which account for more than 90% of GDP \\nhas historically contributed about 30% to revenues. \\nThis limits Nigeria™s ability to credibly execute its \\ndevelopment plans, and results in the economy being \\nvulnerable to macroeconomic shocks from oil price \\nvolatility. This underscores the need for the country \\nto seek ways to mobilise more domestic resources to \\nfund Nigeria™s development needs.\\nThe Roundtable on ﬁLeveraging Domestic Resource \\nMobilisation for Sustainable Developmentﬂ discussed \\n\\n\\nexpenditure side), assessed the extent of public \\nenlightenment and compliance in revenue mobilisation, \\nproffered global perspectives for comparative \\nanalysis on revenue mobilisation strategies, and made \\n\\nand revenue mobilisation.\\nThe CEO of Proshare, Mr. Olufemi Awoyemi, \\nmoderated the panel discussion that included Dr. \\nDoyin Salami (Resident Commissioner, NESG Fiscal \\nPolicy Roundtable), Dr. Salamatu Isah (Adviser on \\nEconomic & Investment matters to the Governor of \\nKaduna State), Mr. Amine Mati (Mission Chief, IMF/\\nSenior Resident Representative), Dr. Neil McCulloch \\n(Principal, The Policy Practice) and Prof. Teju Somorin \\n(Coordinating Dean of Chartered Institute of Taxation \\nof Nigeria Tax Faculties).\\nThe Roundtable acknowledged that emerging \\n\\ninternal resources, such as tax, to fund developmental \\nneeds. Low revenue mobilisation and high spending \\n\\non debt service and strain on the allocation \\nof resources toward social and infrastructural \\ndevelopment projects. This strain has been further \\n\\npopulation growth placing burden on existing social \\nand physical infrastructure in the country. One major \\n\\n\\nis growing evidence that strict adherence to the \\n\\nimpact the effective allocation of resources. such \\nas provisions of the Public Procurement Act and \\nthe Fiscal Responsibility Act. The participants also \\nhighlighted the lack of effectiveness of the budget \\nplanning process. It was their view that the current \\nbudget planning process (presentation of budget, \\nparliamentary approval etc.) is not optimal for effective \\nrevenue mobilisation and this is compounded by the \\nover-reliance on macro-data for budgetary planning \\nas well as budget cycle misalignments vis-à-vis the \\nMedium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). There \\nis also the challenge of inadequate funding of the \\ncollection exercise including tools for cross-checking \\ntaxpayer declarations by the national and sub-national \\ngovernments. Ultimately, this has led to low tax \\n\\nadministrative autonomy of tax administrators (except \\nfor the FIRS and LIRS) hence tax administrators are \\nnot allowed to allocate funding to tax administration \\nfrom the tax revenues. \\nDomestic resource mobilization also suffers a lack of \\neducation and awareness of tax payers on tax laws. \\nAs a result, eligible taxpayers, particularly those in \\nthe informal sector, are not aware of their roles and \\nresponsibilities regarding tax compliance while overall, \\ntax payers are not well-informed or enlightened on \\n\\nof the government in addition to low active taxpayer \\npopulation, inaccurate taxpayer registration database \\nand under-developed compliance/ risk management \\nmethods further worsened by the existence of \\nirrelevant tax incentives and failed application of \\nrelevant ones to motivate tax payers. The same lack \\n\\nnumber of them operating across national and sub-\\nnational level, lack adequate knowledge of the various \\ntax laws and codes that exist in the country. This is \\nfurther hampered by the lack of accountability and \\ntransparency of tax administrators.\\n\\nTax (VAT) system is archaic because it operates like a \\nsales tax and disallows input credit on capital goods/ \\nservices (taxing investments, and abuse of VAT \\nexemptions and other tax incentives under the CIT \\nsystem). It does not have any registration threshold \\n(all companies and persons that make supplies of \\ngoods and services are subject to VAT) and the tax \\nbase is further weakened by large exemptions. \\nDomestic Resource Mobilization\\n130At 5%, VAT in Nigeria is one of the lowest rates \\ninternationally so VAT revenues in Nigeria average \\n0.8% of GDP as against the 3.8% of GDP collected \\n\\nonly 3% of the VAT revenue, the current low tax payer \\n\\nweak service delivery by taxpayers, further exacerbated \\nby weaknesses in revenue administration. \\nParticipants at the Roundtable largely decried the \\nmultiplicity of taxes across national and sub-nationals. \\nThere are currently over sixty-six (66) different \\ntax charges levied by national and sub-nationals \\non corporate organisations. This has impacted \\n\\nbusinesses hampering much-needed funds for growth \\nand expansion. At the individual level, about 94% of the \\npoor pay more taxes combined than the rich, which is \\nuncharacteristic when compared with other countries \\nwhereas, in the United States, South Africa and United \\nKingdom, the top 1% pay more taxes combined than \\nthe bottom 99%, 90% and 75% respectively.\\nWith this myriad of issues and challenges, a number \\nof measures were proposed for Nigeria to leveraging \\ndomestic resource mobilisation for sustainable \\ndevelopment. We have to create growth-stimulating \\n\\npolicy by identifying incentives that would stimulate \\nindustrial growth and ultimately revenue growth \\nthrough the implementation of tax policies. Nigeria \\nmust also strictly adhere to rules and procedures \\n\\naspects of procurement) is important in achieving \\neffective revenue allocation. It is also important to \\nemphasise the role of private capital in plugging \\nresource shortfalls and provide an enabling platform \\nfor active private sector participation in driving capital \\nmobilisation to compensate for the resource shortfalls \\narising from low tax yields. Other key recommendations \\ninclude increase in public enlightenment campaigns \\non tax compliance, particularly players in the informal \\nsector (there is a need to inform eligible taxpayers of \\nhow tax compliance contributes to the country™s tax \\nrevenue and ultimately economic development), align \\nbudget implementation with the MTEF (and develop a \\nmechanism for resolving budget cycle misalignments), \\nshore up revenues to drive government expenditures \\nthat stimulate growth and developmental outcomes, \\nand identify the developmental needs and the level of \\nexpenditure required and the corresponding optimal \\nrevenue generation activities.\\nThe Roundtable also called for a reform of the VAT Act to \\nbroaden the tax base, remove VAT exemptions (or use \\nonly a few, very well-targeted exemptions), introduce \\nregistration threshold to limit application only to larger \\ntax payers (individuals and companies), revise tax \\ndesign, allow input tax credits for intermediary inputs \\nand capital expenditures to limit tax cascading effect \\nas well as single VAT rate with zero-rate applied to \\nexports, and double VAT from 5% to 10% which would \\nresult in about 2.5% of GDP in additional revenue. \\nHowever, it is important to note that increasing VAT \\nrate will lead to an increase in poverty rate but to keep \\npoverty rate constant, the government must introduce \\nsocial programs, transfers to the poor, which are \\nexpected to cost about 0.7% of GDP resulting in a net \\nrevenue gain. It is expected that these reforms will \\nincrease compliance levels from 25% to 60% which \\ncould double current revenue collection.\\nThe government should also improve tax and customs \\nadministration and continue to seek to strengthen \\nrevenue collection by expanding the number of \\nregistered taxpayers and leveraging information \\ntechnology. Key priorities should be to improve \\ntaxpayer register (unique TIN, use of ITAS), improve \\n\\ninitiatives, data analysis, and cross-matching/ data \\n\\nbase by making use of third-party information and \\nmanage collection of arrears.\\n131Humanitarian Development Peace Nexus: Leaving No One Behind\\nOver the past decade, North-Eastern Nigeria has been \\n\\nthat has attracted global attention leading to a lot of \\nhumanitarian aid. Nigeria is foraging a new model of \\nnationally led coordination efforts to promote better \\ncoherence and coordinated support to the recovery \\nand peace consolidation in the country, in line with the \\nnational vision and development priorities as set out in \\nthe Economic Recovery and Growth Plan. Central to the \\nlast conversation on the Humanitarian Development \\nPeace Nexus in June 2018 was the importance of \\nhumanitarian issues not being considered in isolation \\nbut in conjunction with development and peace. \\n\\nthe private sector can provide to these efforts. One \\nkey objective of this Roundtable on ﬁHumanitarian \\nDevelopment Peace Nexus: Leaving No One Behindﬂ \\nwas to align on future partnerships that is essential \\nto Nigeria™s development and prosperity. It was also \\nconvened to explore ways to address issues in the \\n\\npublic and private stakeholders as well as developing \\nand implementing recovery strategies for economic \\ngrowth and development. \\nThe discussions were moderated by Dr.Ayoade \\nAlakija (Nexus Coordinator) and the lead discussants \\nwere Mrs. Zainab Ahmed (Honourable Minister of \\nFinance), His Excellency W Stuart Symington (US \\nAmbassador to the Federal Republic of Nigeria), Mr. \\nAsue Ighodalo (Chairman, Nigerian Economic Summit \\nGroup), Mrs. Eme Essie Lore (Country Manager, \\nInternational Finance Corporation), Ms. Myrta Kaulard \\n(representative of the World Food Programme), Mr. \\nStephen Haykin (Mission Director, USAID) and Ketil \\nKarlsen (Head of Delegation, EU Delegation to Nigeria) \\n\\nby partners (Federal, States, and Humanitarian \\norganisations) as major challenge. \\nAlthough the government and humanitarian aid \\norganisations collaborate in providing basic aids to \\nthe North East, there is need for a more integrated and \\ncoordinated approach to address the humanitarian \\nand development needs in the region. Government \\nagencies and most humanitarian organisations are \\nworking in silos and, as a result of this, there is the \\nfear that rebuilding of the North East region will take \\na long time to actualise. In addition to this, there is \\na weak collaboration between the private and public \\nsectors in the provision of humanitarian aid. This may \\nbe attributable to inadequate communication to/with \\nthe private sector which has led to a seeming apathy \\non the part of Nigerians. This calls for a multi-sectoral \\napproach to humanitarian assistance to achieve the \\nSustainable Development Goals. Another issue is \\nthe sustainability of recovery strategies. Nigeria has \\nreceived millions in humanitarian aid, however, there \\nis need for more practical and durable solutions to \\nensure sustainability. Vulnerable populations need to \\nbe provided with enabling factors to stand on their \\nown. Sustainability of the peace in the North East \\nhas been a major issue due to the pockets of violent \\nattacks in the region and there is the possibility of \\nacts of retaliation in areas that have been rehabilitated \\nand the challenge of protecting the displaced in the \\nIDPs camps due to possible attacks. The inadequate \\nsecurity hinders access to the vulnerable population \\nand this high operational risk due to poor security \\nand weak institutional presence inhibits meaningful \\nprivate sector participation. \\nOther challenges discussed at the Roundtable were \\n\\n(livelihood development is a recurring theme for \\n\\nbetween local and international stakeholders (the \\n\\nregion and poor engagement of local members of \\nthe community may have led to scepticism within \\nthe community while the lack of transparency in use \\n\\nparticularly in the private sector.\\nThe Roundtable recommended an integrated approach \\nand conscious collaboration between the government \\nand humanitarian agencies. There should be a culture \\nof collaboration between the Government at all \\nlevels and humanitarian agencies in the provision of \\ndevelopment need to prevent overlapping activities. \\nThis would mean taking an integrated approach in all \\nfronts: politics, security, and development. \\nThe Federal Government should engage more with \\ninternational partners for resources and expertise \\nin peace building. Government needs to provide \\nleadership in the Nexus and development opportunity \\nwhile innovation and value chain development can be \\ndelivered by the international community. Participants \\nalso urged the government and humanitarian agencies \\nto collaborate with the private sector to provide \\nessential services. Engagement with the private sector \\nis necessary for sustainable recovery. This concerted \\npartnership between the public and private sector will \\nensure that the vulnerable people are not left behind. \\nHumanitarian Development\\n132Key areas of potential collaboration with the private \\nsector includes: low housing scheme, transportation, \\nlocal production of nutritious food, mobile money, \\ndigital registration systems, solar energy and fuel-\\n\\n\\nattracted in expanding their business in this region. \\nThe focus should be on human capital investment by \\nproviding basic education and skill acquisition training. \\nGovernment should provide waivers and incentives to \\nencourage private sector investment in human capital \\ndevelopment to provide the people of the region with \\njobs and livelihoods, such as smart subsidies for \\ninvestors with long term investment outlook. \\nNESG is well positioned to enhance the collaboration \\nof private, public and humanitarian aid and has \\ncommitted to communicate the message to its \\nprivate sector partners. In addition, there should be a \\ngovernment-led security strategy to enhance delivery \\nof humanitarian aid to the vulnerable population. \\nReconstruction is dependent on the security and the \\nability to deliver humanitarian aid. Operational risks \\nshould be broken down, this would create a path for \\nsustainability. The private sector and citizens should \\nensure safe and prosperous communities by providing \\n\\nagainst insurgency and other criminal activities in the \\ncountry. Without security and peace, humanitarian \\nassistance and investments can neither be provided \\nnor achieve its objectives. The Government should \\nprovide a secure condition for human capital to \\nfunction. Businesses cannot price for security tasks. \\nIt was suggested that the IFC, possibly in conjunction \\nwith the NDIC and other relevant government agencies, \\nshould consider provision of wrap around insurance \\narrangement for those who want to do business in the \\nregion.\\nIt is also very important that all partners mobilize \\nincreased response from Nigerians generally in \\nthe redevelopment of the North-East region and \\nother regions of the nation. A good starting point is \\nengaging with people who are heavily invested, for \\nexample, captains of industry that are indigenes \\nof the area, to invest in the region. This will foster \\ndeeper community engagement and improve the \\nNigerian brand. In addition, humanitarian programs \\nshould reach out to local members of the community \\nto support implementation and scale up strategy. In \\nconcluding, the Roundtable proposed an engagement \\n\\nintervention arrangement for the region. The CBN can \\n\\nservices to those living in the North East region.  \\nThis will contribute to the sustainability of livelihood \\ndevelopment. \\n133Powering Economic Transformation in Business through Sustainability: The Coca-Cola Story\\nThe Coca-Cola Company was named World \\nSustainability Leader in the Beverage Industry for the \\nthird consecutive year by Dow Jones Sustainability \\nIndex, for its global sustainability commitments, \\nincluding its ambitious goals such as deriving 40% \\nof its total energy used from renewable and clean \\nenergy sources by 2020, engaging young people \\non new growth and economic opportunities and its \\nvision in which 40% of packaging globally is recycled \\nand put back into the system for reuse. Coca-Cola \\noperates under the fundamental philosophy that ﬁOur \\nbusiness is only as sustainable as the communities in \\nwhich we operateﬂ and are investing in programmes \\nand partnerships with industry, government and civil \\nsociety to help build better communities around the \\nworld, through inclusive and sustainable development. \\nThis Roundtable focused on discussing sustainability \\nprinciples and practices support businesses to \\n\\nsupporting people and protecting the environment. \\nThe sustainability practices and vision of the Coca-\\nCola Company were discussed in view of the Federal \\nGovernment of Nigeria™s plans to promote the \\ncapture and use of gas as a cleaner energy source \\nfor businesses. Participants also discussed the un-\\ncompetitiveness and high cost of doing business \\nin Nigeria and its impact on value-chains as well as \\naccelerating the adoption of cleaner energy resources \\nand promoting energy access for productive uses \\nto drive economic growth. There is a commitment \\n\\nCommercialisation Programme as well as promoting \\nthe expansion and utilisation of gas resources with \\nthe aim of achieving its 20% climate change mitigation \\ntargets as well as promoting the use of cleaner energy \\nresources to drive economic growth, employment \\nand wealth creation. The Coca-Cola sustainability \\ninitiatives focus on four areas: water, women and \\nyouth, wellbeing, and waste management.\\nThe lead discussant was Mr. Bhupendra Suri \\n(Managing Director, Coca-Cola Nigeria). Other \\ndiscussants were Mr. Justice Derefaka (Programme \\nManager, Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization \\nProgramme) and Mr. Dayo Adeshina (Programme \\n\\nVice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria). The \\nRoundtable was moderated by Dr. Uzo Egbuche, (CEO, \\nCERASE Environmental Services Limited).\\nParticipants highlighted the need for a veritable \\ncontinuous cross-sectoral dialogue platform for \\ncontinuous public and private sector dialogue to \\npromote effective communication, brainstorming and \\ncreation of synergies amongst stakeholders in the \\nplan, design and executive sustainable development \\nstrategies. The NESG was commended for hosting \\nthe Roundtable and participants advocated for \\na continuous dialogue and engagement on key \\nsustainability issues. Another issue that caught the \\nattention of the participants is the high cost of doing \\nbusiness and un-competitiveness of manufacturing \\n\\nsuch as unreliable electricity supply, poor transport \\nnetwork, unstable regulatory environment and poor \\nimplementation of policies all lead to a higher cost of \\ndoing business in Nigeria because all the production \\ncosts are eventually transferred to the end-consumers. \\nNigeria and India are both high population and low-\\nincome countries. However, the higher cost of doing \\nbusiness in Nigeria makes the country a very tight \\nmarket to play-in, especially because of our low-buying \\npower. \\n\\nand energy eecurity challenges in view of climate \\nchange protection. In harnessing Nigeria™s Flare Gas \\ntowards affordable, clean and sustainable energy for \\nbusinesses and society, the Nigerian Government \\nhas put various policies and programs in place such \\nas; the Nigerian Gas Master Plan, the Nigerian Gas \\nFlare Commercialisation Programme (NGFCP) and \\nthe Gas Expansion Project with the aim of monetising \\ndomestic gas resources, while promoting access to \\nmore environmentally friendly energy services using \\nclean and renewable technologies. The 324 billion \\n\\nin 2017 alone could have generated about 3GW of \\nelectricity, mitigated 22 million tons of CO2 emissions \\nand avoided revenue loss more than US$1 billion and \\nanother US$500 million in carbon credits. Yet, about \\n100 million Nigerian™s are without grid-power and \\nself-generate about 14GW using petrol and diesel \\n\\ngrowing population of Nigeria at 3% per annum may \\nreach about 398 million people by 2050, which means, \\nthere will be increased demand for energy services.\\n Sustainability134To address these issues, the Roundtable participants \\nemphasized partnership with industry, government, \\nlocal communities, NGOs and peers to encourage \\ncontinuous dialogue with relevant stakeholders. This \\nwill lead to increased participation of cross-sectoral \\nstakeholders especially the Ministries, Department \\nand Agencies of government (MDAs). It is also \\nimportant to streamline the application process \\nfor accessing the NGFCP and the representative \\n\\na commitment to look out for opportunities for \\nsynergy with other fast-moving consumer goods \\ncompanies (FMCG). Nigerians should also move \\naway from dirty fuels towards cleaner alternatives, \\nacross transportation, domestic cooking and heating \\nand electricity services while government ought to \\nincrease access of independent oil producers to oil \\n\\npartial grant and operational subsidies to develop our \\ngas infrastructure. To achieve this, efforts must be \\nmade to coordinate a cross-sectoral implementation \\nto stimulate demand as LPG can be used to displace \\nother low-pour fuels. This will create opportunities for small and medium \\nscale businesses to develop or procure hybridised \\nenergy systems using gas and Solar PV (for example) \\nto meet their energy needs. We should also assess \\nthe entire agriculture/product value-chain as \\nopportunities for implementing sustainable practices \\nand participants requested the government to \\ndisseminate the NGFCP on-going Report that provides \\ndata on the kind of fuels that will be displaced by these \\ngas interventions.\\nTo improve the un-competitiveness and cost of doing \\nbusiness in Nigeria, the government has to clarify \\ncurrent regulations and implement additional enabling \\npolicies by ensuring all factors are in place to promote \\nsustainability as well as improve collaboration \\nand communication on sustainable initiatives. The \\nNigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) \\ncan prepare investment friendly deck for small \\nbusinesses that require investments in their projects. \\nAt the Roundtable, the Coca-Cola Company agreed to \\n\\nimproves the Ease of Doing Business in Nigeria.\\nThe role of government in creating an enabling \\nbusiness environment can never be overemphasised. \\nFortunately, the government is committed to \\nfacilitating the adoption of renewable energy and gas \\n\\nenergy demand. \\nThe priority for government is to develop gas \\ninfrastructure, facilitate gas revolution projects, \\n\\nGas (LPG) and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), reduce \\n\\nfor implementation, and promote gas-to-power \\nprojects. The key focus areas are policy and regulation; \\nenabling business environment and investment; \\n\\ncapacity; Niger Delta Militancy issues; and stabilising \\n\\nmanagement; and international coordination. About \\nUS$3.5 billion worth of inward-investments is required \\n\\nby year 2020. Turnkey systems that are scalable and \\n\\ninto high-value fuels and chemicals to be developed by \\ncompetent third-party investors.\\nIn conclusion, 80% of businesses cite lack of \\nelectricity as the biggest constraint to doing business \\nin Nigeria. Yet over 14GW of expensive self-generation \\nexits in Nigeria. The Coca-Cola Company generates \\nabout 28.8MW operated off-grid in ‚island mode™ that \\nexceeds its daily factory consumption more than 30%. \\nThis leads to high cost of production and subsequently \\nhigh cost of products for end-consumers. Increasingly, \\nSmall and Medium Scale businesses and industrial \\nclusters are adopting the use of hybrid technologies \\nwith solar PV and other power systems to further \\nreduce their cost of electricity services. The National \\nLPG Expansion Plan seeks to support interested \\nprivate sector players for the adoption and utilisation \\nof gas for productive uses while industries are now \\n\\nachieve it.\\n135Pioneering New Models: Systemic Human Capacity Development and Wealth Creation Œ \\nLessons from the Niger Delta. \\nIn collaboration with Partnership Initiatives in the \\nNiger Delta (PIND), this Roundtable brought together \\npractitioners, businesses, government leaders, and \\ncitizens to explore this innovative human capacity \\ndevelopment approach, which functions to increase \\nthe degree of autonomy and self-determination in the \\nlives of people and communities, which enables them \\nto represent their interests in a responsible, and self-\\ndetermined way, acting on their own volition to achieve \\neconomic prosperity. Through its Niger Delta Youth \\nEmployment Pathways (NDYEP) program, PIND works \\nto develop model pathways of workforce development \\nand job-readiness that would provide employment and \\nentrepreneurship for the region™s unemployed young \\nmen and women. The key objective was to share PIND™s insight and \\nlessons learned from using its model of human \\ncapacity development to foster sustainable economic \\nopportunities in productive sectors, especially for \\nthe youth population and to enhance civil society™s \\nrole in promoting good governance aimed at poverty \\nreduction priorities in Nigeria™s Niger Delta. It was \\nexpected that it will recommend ways of adapting \\nthe PIND model of human capacity development in \\ndifferent sectors: agricultural market system, MSMEs, \\nskills development, civil society and peace ecosystem. \\nThere is an estimated 40% unemployment rate among \\nNiger Delta youth. This is usually a result of key factors \\nsuch as the lack of economic opportunity, a mismatch \\nbetween skills and training delivery, and poor quality \\nof training offered to the youths. The two states with \\nthe highest unemployment rate in Nigeria, are within \\nthe Niger Delta region and three sectors have been \\n\\nconstruction. However, the unsustainability of most development \\ninterventions once a project ends is huge challenge. \\nDuring a project™s life-cycle there are positive \\nresults felt, however once the project ends, results \\nare not sustained. The Systemic Human Capacity \\nDevelopment approach developed by PIND aims to \\ndevelop a self-sustaining model which continues \\nto deliver results after a project has ended because \\nthe traditional interventionist approach is often not \\nsustainable as there is limited ownership from the \\nparticipants. \\n\\nare incentivized to investment in and participate. \\nFor example, it was observed by PIND that people \\n\\nin the Niger Delta region are often unable to thrive \\nas a result of poor farming techniques and market \\n\\nlimited human resource and technical capabilities, \\nand as such PIND initiatives often focus on human \\nand technical capability interventions and the creation \\nof awareness within the eco-system. While several \\ninterventions in the area of capacity building have been \\nemployed by development partners and civil society \\norganizations over the years, there is a disconnect \\nbetween the trainings being offered and employment \\nopportunities. Trainings offered often do not translate \\nto jobs because there is limited synergy between \\ninstitutions and the industry. PIND works towards \\n\\nskills, soft skills and entrepreneurship and lessons \\nfrom intervention. In the pre-intervention assessment \\nphase, it is often observed that CSOs in the Niger Delta \\nhave weak processes and structures, which resulted \\nin challenges when securing partnerships and funding \\nfrom international development partners. Concurrently, \\nCSOs in the region have limited collaboration and \\nlimited capacity and knowledge transfer among CSO \\npartners. The quality of training offered by CSOs is \\noften inadequate. PIND works to ensure that results are sustained by \\nempowering the participants to carry on their own \\nprojects. This can be done by ensuring that participants \\nmake some sort of investments in their capacity \\nbuilding. During the projects, ample training and \\ncapacity development is provided and a post training \\nsupport is used to monitor reinforce progress. PIND \\nalso collaborates with several partners both locally and \\ninternationally. PIND engages in several partnerships \\nsuch as: collaborative programs with government \\ninstitutes, trainings and internships programs with \\nuniversities in the region, and partnerships with \\nprivate sector actors with commercial interest in the \\nregion. The Human Capital Development approach \\ndeveloped by PIND encourages partners utilizing the \\nPIND model to consistently search for viable solutions \\nand collaborative partnerships. \\nWealth Creation\\n136These are designed to ensure that the supply of human \\ncapital requirements meets the demand for services \\nin the Niger Delta region through capacity building and \\ncontinuous training across all development segments \\nof PIND interventions in the Niger Delta Region. \\nProjects should be demand driven interventions to \\npromote employability of people in the Niger Delta \\nregion. There is also continuous promotion of youth \\ninnovative training programs with a focus on ICT, \\nconstruction and agriculture because of the need to \\nfocus on providing employment opportunities and \\nfostering employability among youth in the Niger Delta \\nregion. \\nThis can be done by ensuring that synergy exists \\nbetween training institutions and the requirements \\nin the industry. Additionally, interventions with \\n\\nentrepreneurship are critical to the development of a \\nsustainable training program. It is argued that if the \\nPIND model is working in the Niger Delta region, there \\nis an opportunity for the process to be implemented \\nin other regions and development sectors around \\nthe country. Some elements of the Systemic Human \\nDevelopment such as pre-intervention assessment and \\npost-training support are key and must be adopted by \\nother players in the development sectors. If the model \\nis adopted, project results can be sustained. PIND has \\nshared knowledge with partners outside the Niger \\nDelta region such as the North-East Development \\nInitiative. \\n137138139140141Poverty to \\nProsperity: \\nTheme:\\nMaking Governance
